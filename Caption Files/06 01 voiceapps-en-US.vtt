00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.938
The Internet makes it possible
for us to stay in touch with our

9fceacb8-f038-4a48-af93-1e1acdbb4186-1
00:00:03.938 --> 00:00:05.400
friends, family and colleagues.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.072
Online communication can happen
in real time with apps and

9f427325-35cf-424e-b6d7-461c1a63f533-1
00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:12.932
services that make it easy to
chat through instant messaging,

9f427325-35cf-424e-b6d7-461c1a63f533-2
00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:14.800
voice calling and video calls.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.813
Instant messaging is a text
based form of communication

8ebaba03-d3bf-4c3a-91d0-5509277363b1-1
00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:22.060
where you can type messages on
your computer or mobile device

8ebaba03-d3bf-4c3a-91d0-5509277363b1-2
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.256
to send to people who can then
instantly read and respond to

8ebaba03-d3bf-4c3a-91d0-5509277363b1-3
00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:26.879
your messages on their devices.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.392
Voice calling over the Internet
is similar to traditional phone

f54de267-f4ee-4af3-9186-6a384067efdc-1
00:00:31.392 --> 00:00:34.654
calls, only instead of using a
landline or mobile phone, you

f54de267-f4ee-4af3-9186-6a384067efdc-2
00:00:34.654 --> 00:00:37.702
place your call over the
Internet using an app and video

f54de267-f4ee-4af3-9186-6a384067efdc-3
00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:40.857
calling is like a voice call,
but where you and the people

f54de267-f4ee-4af3-9186-6a384067efdc-4
00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:43.210
you're calling can hear and see
each other.

0561a89d-7c7e-4257-8cec-e011eceafc56-0
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.314
Which of these three forms of
communication you use depends on

0561a89d-7c7e-4257-8cec-e011eceafc56-1
00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.570
what you determine is
appropriate at the time.

b5ef05ce-598b-4fef-bfce-c0b6d2396eaf-0
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.424
If you just need to ask a quick
question, but don't necessarily

b5ef05ce-598b-4fef-bfce-c0b6d2396eaf-1
00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:56.450
need an immediate response, you
can send an instant message.

b6f92105-d28a-440d-9948-9466cb648753-0
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.260
Your recipients can then respond
when they have a moment.

734ddc51-f995-44f0-9ad1-3ec870df799d-0
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.980
If you need a more immediate
reply, you can try a voice call.

cd5e3e30-9a84-4214-92f2-0a15073f5c83-0
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.485
And video based calls can make
it easier to have certain

cd5e3e30-9a84-4214-92f2-0a15073f5c83-1
00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:09.238
conversations because you can
see each other and read the

cd5e3e30-9a84-4214-92f2-0a15073f5c83-2
00:01:09.238 --> 00:01:10.900
expressions on each caller's
face.

b94c38d1-df5a-4cda-b2a9-b6ce8f9e2e52-0
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.309
In many cases, there are apps
that allow you to use all three

b94c38d1-df5a-4cda-b2a9-b6ce8f9e2e52-1
00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.991
of these forms of communication,
while other apps focus

b94c38d1-df5a-4cda-b2a9-b6ce8f9e2e52-2
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:19.620
specifically on one or two
types.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.360
Apple FaceTime, for example,
allows you to make voice and

31b6bc40-1201-4f99-a692-a9c80bb2946c-1
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.193
video calls, but you use a
separate Apple App called

31b6bc40-1201-4f99-a692-a9c80bb2946c-2
00:01:26.193 --> 00:01:27.849
iMessage for instant messaging.

56a821b9-ef8c-4530-bad6-ecad655571bf-0
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.915
Another example is WhatsApp,
which is an app that lets you

56a821b9-ef8c-4530-bad6-ecad655571bf-1
00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:34.410
send messages and voice and
video chat as well.

9bbee9f2-596b-48b8-ac2c-38fdf1bd8c87-0
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.675
And there's also Skype, which in
addition to instant messages and

9bbee9f2-596b-48b8-ac2c-38fdf1bd8c87-1
00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.893
voice and video chatting, is
also one of the few apps through

9bbee9f2-596b-48b8-ac2c-38fdf1bd8c87-2
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.800
which you can call phone
numbers, letting you make both

9bbee9f2-596b-48b8-ac2c-38fdf1bd8c87-3
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.018
domestic and international calls
from your computer or mobile

9bbee9f2-596b-48b8-ac2c-38fdf1bd8c87-4
00:01:48.018 --> 00:01:48.330
phone.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.435
In this chapter, we'll look more
closely at communicating using

4e673d43-4f0d-4554-9136-15e10dd1bc3e-1
00:01:52.435 --> 00:01:52.730
Skype.
