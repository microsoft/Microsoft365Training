00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.525
There are several tyes of media
that many of us come across on a

08ccf7c4-3c1b-40ff-af21-1c079dbc0b35-1
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:04.080
daily basis.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.263
These include traditional media
like newspapers, magazines,

7c5f5d9e-dd2f-4e9a-a415-7983a7653b30-1
00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:12.131
books, TV and radio, but also
relatively newer forms of media

7c5f5d9e-dd2f-4e9a-a415-7983a7653b30-2
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:15.688
like e-mail, web articles,
social media posts, and a lot

7c5f5d9e-dd2f-4e9a-a415-7983a7653b30-3
00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:16.000
more.

cbdf4646-505e-494e-a915-68b39444797f-0
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010
We're constantly being inundated
by media that wants our

cbdf4646-505e-494e-a915-68b39444797f-1
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.440
attention.

2bbdb3a5-6e8c-4373-9311-187c10f600ae-0
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.020
It's easy to become overwhelmed
by the flow of information if we

2bbdb3a5-6e8c-4373-9311-187c10f600ae-1
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.519
don't develo the skills to
navigate our way through the

2bbdb3a5-6e8c-4373-9311-187c10f600ae-2
00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.151
ocean of information that
surrounds us every day and learn

2bbdb3a5-6e8c-4373-9311-187c10f600ae-3
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:30.159
to evaluate information with a
critical eye.

d86e6721-b171-4224-a84b-4771049f1fc8-0
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.683
Each year comanies send large
sums of money on Internet

d86e6721-b171-4224-a84b-4771049f1fc8-1
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:36.656
advertising to the point where
the line between information an

d86e6721-b171-4224-a84b-4771049f1fc8-2
00:00:36.656 --> 00:00:38.120
advertisements becomes blurred.

26f2e86e-c6bf-4698-ac21-57ea9f2dae96-0
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.444
Other media can be filled with
the attitudes and oinions of

26f2e86e-c6bf-4698-ac21-57ea9f2dae96-1
00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:44.089
others, while other forms of
media hide their message under

26f2e86e-c6bf-4698-ac21-57ea9f2dae96-2
00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.720
the surface of what we see and
hear.

36639b84-02ce-4eee-a91e-97662ab9e32d-0
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.807
O It's important to develop
media literacy in order to avoid

36639b84-02ce-4eee-a91e-97662ab9e32d-1
00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:52.857
just assively accepting all
messages and instead learn to

36639b84-02ce-4eee-a91e-97662ab9e32d-2
00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:55.959
think carefully and critically
about the media we consume.

9fcd0af4-5a11-40bc-9872-661fe490860c-0
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.468
Here are five basic questions
you can ask when you encounter

9fcd0af4-5a11-40bc-9872-661fe490860c-1
00:00:59.468 --> 00:01:01.875
new information and want to
determine its accuracy and

9fcd0af4-5a11-40bc-9872-661fe490860c-2
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:02.400
reliability.

eac56504-fce1-47ed-a0c0-7ed22885a1f4-0
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.360
Question one Who created the
message.

027684fc-3dab-47b6-b9ca-d5617a9d29aa-0
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.701
Knowing who created the message
may give you some insight in

027684fc-3dab-47b6-b9ca-d5617a9d29aa-1
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:09.960
their purposes for doing so.

1a278848-8dda-4602-a5c4-6a187abf3c3a-0
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.040
Was it to sell you something to
promote something?

2548c43c-15a8-4ef9-b0fc-bec05df0b102-0
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.640
Or was it to genuinely share
information?

0f04ef18-fc70-4ff0-85f8-d881230d5e1b-0
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.115
It's difficult to have a
completely unbiased perspective,

0f04ef18-fc70-4ff0-85f8-d881230d5e1b-1
00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:21.765
but it's important to determine
if the bias outweighs or

0f04ef18-fc70-4ff0-85f8-d881230d5e1b-2
00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:23.020
influences the information.

c4594ec5-82a3-4f13-aede-cdaf007f89d0-0
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.009
And asking who created the
message can help give you the

c4594ec5-82a3-4f13-aede-cdaf007f89d0-1
00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.780
distance to see the information
being resented more clearly.

58744567-7107-4e12-93d9-e6e0d0ed0e59-0
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.915
Question two What techniques are
being used to cature your

58744567-7107-4e12-93d9-e6e0d0ed0e59-1
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:33.420
attention?

e171cef5-3edb-4946-8e23-dc930e50f26d-0
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.300
Is information being resented in
a colorful video with Hay Music?

45c168ec-e139-4072-8a53-344f8b86ca1c-0
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740
Is it being delivered in ominous
tones?

eb5c2904-d517-4b6c-ac5a-b2fd0a506adf-0
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.671
With sensationalist hrasing, the
way the message is being

eb5c2904-d517-4b6c-ac5a-b2fd0a506adf-1
00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:45.400
presented can have a big
influence on how you erceive

eb5c2904-d517-4b6c-ac5a-b2fd0a506adf-2
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.260
that information.

8afdc117-dd83-41ec-8690-ed0ec0d64689-0
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.220
Question 3 How might different
people interpret this message?

98a9f9ec-0941-446d-a2c7-80db6011739c-0
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.706
We all consume information a
little differently, and it's

98a9f9ec-0941-446d-a2c7-80db6011739c-1
00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:56.425
important to step outside our
own perspective to explore

98a9f9ec-0941-446d-a2c7-80db6011739c-2
00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:57.380
multiple viewpoints.

d350f87f-d5c8-4463-a9e7-acb94718ac83-0
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.544
Some information you come across
may not take into account the

d350f87f-d5c8-4463-a9e7-acb94718ac83-1
00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:02.140
perspective and experience of
others.

b30c48b9-0422-41dd-abdb-be1b7332ea42-0
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.540
Question four is what's being
left out of the message?

a783a1b8-d6dc-4e20-877e-7ddf8f73515e-0
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.167
What oints of view, lifestyles
or values are being expressed in

a783a1b8-d6dc-4e20-877e-7ddf8f73515e-1
00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:11.260
or alternately left out of the
message?

2f11653a-435c-4328-93a0-255b5deac5cd-0
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.780
When making a message, the
author makes choices about what

2f11653a-435c-4328-93a0-255b5deac5cd-1
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.621
to keep in an what to leave out,
and these choices can reflect

2f11653a-435c-4328-93a0-255b5deac5cd-2
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:19.199
the author's values and
attitudes.

d70ee0c7-67c9-4165-a30a-468b21b28472-0
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.309
Are certain perspectives being
deliberately left out of the

d70ee0c7-67c9-4165-a30a-468b21b28472-1
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:23.680
message to influence your
opinion?

0794061b-01b4-45b2-870c-b7f780f1ad0b-0
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.560
And question 5.

e255493b-ba8d-4c6d-bd3c-23a0c7e95968-0
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.320
Why is this message being sent?

5ac846a8-5a1a-4f54-8b85-dacbd25efd73-0
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.546
The purpose of this question is
to examine the motivation of

5ac846a8-5a1a-4f54-8b85-dacbd25efd73-1
00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.200
sending the message in the first
lace.

c47d567a-f7bb-426a-9641-7d6684e29276-0
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.683
It goes beyond the idea that
media is just there to entertain

c47d567a-f7bb-426a-9641-7d6684e29276-1
00:02:35.683 --> 00:02:38.320
and inform, and asks who
benefits from this message.

50f0dd66-1615-49e6-b4f4-87440d7cb0b2-0
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.894
These five questions are not the
only questions you can and

50f0dd66-1615-49e6-b4f4-87440d7cb0b2-1
00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.547
should ask when evaluating
media, but they can rovide the

50f0dd66-1615-49e6-b4f4-87440d7cb0b2-2
00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:47.292
necessary foundation to start
thinking critically about the

50f0dd66-1615-49e6-b4f4-87440d7cb0b2-3
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.710
media we engage with every day.
