00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.071
The Internet and the web make it
possible for us to stay

b088420a-dd5e-4194-9d7d-19af28e0b780-1
00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:05.400
connected with friends and
family across the world.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.895
We can use social media and
other platforms to see what's

8538618e-80e6-4a9c-9a63-0b0e716bc7eb-1
00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:12.141
happening in our friends lives,
share personal news, and stay in

8538618e-80e6-4a9c-9a63-0b0e716bc7eb-2
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:13.040
touch with others.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.880
But sharing things online isn't
always safe.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.132
Things you intend to only be
shared with friends could be

f69a0f7c-1874-4b5b-b082-38a3043531ab-1
00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:21.520
found and viewed by strangers in
any number of ways.

4d551fb9-ca5c-4f54-8ac3-4def41c3812c-0
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.600
For example, imagine you've
bought a new car and you want

4d551fb9-ca5c-4f54-8ac3-4def41c3812c-1
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.080
your friends to see it, so you
OST a picture on social media.

af7cdb05-5077-41df-9c1c-5b83c635ee54-0
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.303
That might seem fine, but that
picture includes a lot of

af7cdb05-5077-41df-9c1c-5b83c635ee54-1
00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:31.490
ersonal information about you.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.010
It tells anyone who sees it what
make and model of car you have.

c66dad50-c6a1-4692-8590-fb4ea3028db6-0
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.970
Some people use their car's make
and model as passwords.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.997
If you're one of those people,
you've just otentially shared

f5969f09-65f5-495e-b6e7-fee1068f6c2c-1
00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:42.930
your password, or maybe part of
your password.

fcbedc76-3959-44a3-af56-b2907dcbf104-0
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.527
If the iPhoto includes your
license plate, anyone can see

fcbedc76-3959-44a3-af56-b2907dcbf104-1
00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:49.170
the license plate number and
learn what state you live in.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.193
These might seem like minor
things, but the more you share

926c6872-781a-4e68-8cb6-cbcf69611932-1
00:00:53.193 --> 00:00:56.205
or inadvertently share, easier
it is for someone to learn

926c6872-781a-4e68-8cb6-cbcf69611932-2
00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:59.528
information about you and build
a profile about you, your likes

926c6872-781a-4e68-8cb6-cbcf69611932-3
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:02.540
and dislikes, where you work,
how much you earn an so on.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.575
Now, this doesn't mean you
should never post or share

ba0d02cf-3324-4449-873c-2d4f17f0ff72-1
00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.059
anything to social media, but
it's important to keep safety

ba0d02cf-3324-4449-873c-2d4f17f0ff72-2
00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:09.260
and privacy as a top concern.

e9975be9-c3be-4eb8-91f0-795a33ccaa66-0
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.524
When you share things online, be
sure to review the privacy

e9975be9-c3be-4eb8-91f0-795a33ccaa66-1
00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:14.700
settings of your social media
accounts.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.594
If your account is set to
public, anyone can see your

a8654242-4d88-4439-978d-f5d3e7507a20-1
00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:18.980
information and what you share.

667cda65-3d4f-4926-bcb8-be6773e8cc16-0
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.211
Instead, you should use the
private settings on accounts so

667cda65-3d4f-4926-bcb8-be6773e8cc16-1
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.379
that only your ersonal
connections can see what you

667cda65-3d4f-4926-bcb8-be6773e8cc16-2
00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:24.630
share.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.938
You should also be selective
about accepting invitations to

c9298a44-8c23-4549-a850-6591410ce32e-1
00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:29.510
connect with people on social
media.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.350
Most social media latforms have
a way for you to accept and deny

40b97854-7048-4355-b074-5a713fde1f85-1
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.470
requests to have someone be your
friend or follower on the site.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.550
Think about whether you know the
person in real life and if

4b211265-f17c-413f-aa23-0431255504d1-1
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.910
you're comfortable with them
seeing everything you post on

4b211265-f17c-413f-aa23-0431255504d1-2
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.310
that site.

3ebed4de-2b25-407a-9ca2-1c92dcdb2b50-0
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.064
Usually once you accept someone,
they have direct access to your

3ebed4de-2b25-407a-9ca2-1c92dcdb2b50-1
00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.034
profile an the things you share
O make sure you only interact

3ebed4de-2b25-407a-9ca2-1c92dcdb2b50-2
00:01:49.034 --> 00:01:50.520
with people you know and trust.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.792
Bear in mind that even when you
can control who has access to

6f91f284-d2e4-405d-b6ac-d55b789f3bf5-1
00:01:53.792 --> 00:01:56.386
your profiles and accounts, you
can't control what other people

6f91f284-d2e4-405d-b6ac-d55b789f3bf5-2
00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:57.400
do with your information.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.680
Even your friends could download
your photos or copy what you've

630e8505-56f5-4f89-a891-4adbdfb9b2c1-1
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.840
written to share with others.

a9f3a37f-ce67-40c3-9fec-98dde10dd192-0
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.408
As a general rule, never share
something online that you

a9f3a37f-ce67-40c3-9fec-98dde10dd192-1
00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:08.266
wouldn't want strangers and the
public to see, and always

a9f3a37f-ce67-40c3-9fec-98dde10dd192-2
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.039
remember to think before you
share.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
Do you really need to post what
you're thinking of posting?

3cc45cb1-a703-44f5-8b3b-277b375de9e6-0
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.802
Are you posting emotionally and
will you regret posting it later

3cc45cb1-a703-44f5-8b3b-277b375de9e6-1
00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.905
Kee your safety in mind and make
smart choices when sharing

3cc45cb1-a703-44f5-8b3b-277b375de9e6-2
00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:20.630
things online?
