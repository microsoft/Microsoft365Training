00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.823
You want a lock that's hard to
break, and you don't want anyone

c8b66d34-31f2-404a-b8c7-2b6cb5313593-1
00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:17.280

Avoid using common words in your
password.

0741d82b-eeeb-4fb7-9373-ef3b2f69f840-0
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.499

research these phrases in your

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.810
Let's say I wanted to use the
word Penguin as my password.

197964b7-a3de-47df-a645-e0efcb9fc34a-0
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.194
That's way too common a word O1
trick is to think of ways to

197964b7-a3de-47df-a645-e0efcb9fc34a-1
00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:03.187
obscure the word you want to
use, but still make sure you can

197964b7-a3de-47df-a645-e0efcb9fc34a-2
00:01:03.187 --> 00:01:05.650
remember it when it's time to
enter your password.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.572
Let's say that the year 1972 is
personally important to me, but

826f04ec-f85b-4ca7-a190-fb1d04f9de9b-1
00:01:09.572 --> 00:01:12.703
it's not an obvious year like my
birth year that could be easily

826f04ec-f85b-4ca7-a190-fb1d04f9de9b-2
00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:13.570
guessed by others.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.219
Oi might come U with a password
like this where I place Penguin

e9641fb4-5a96-4841-b68c-18a7879a0ba1-1
00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.188
between the digits of the year
and caitalize two of its letters

e9641fb4-5a96-4841-b68c-18a7879a0ba1-2
00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:23.018
and then I add a symbol at the
end to make it that much more

e9641fb4-5a96-4841-b68c-18a7879a0ba1-3
00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:23.900
difficult to guess.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.621
This is much safer than just
using the word Penguin by itself

5e111a76-5b95-405d-a440-e9abdb357a17-1
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:30.380
and it's a password I can
remember without writing down.

d44ada36-bd11-4348-b442-50e61aec633a-0
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.340
Now with that said, don't use
the same password for multile

d44ada36-bd11-4348-b442-50e61aec633a-1
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.700

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.405
Instead, use different asswords
for different accounts, because

2517c88e-67ee-48b3-be5c-f57e5043caf9-1
00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.134

your bank account, be sure to

a8c1aeee-9628-4c87-a0d1-369c3c29c0bc-1
00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:54.250
use different passwords for each
online account you have, and

a8c1aeee-9628-4c87-a0d1-369c3c29c0bc-2
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.900

When you share it with others,

00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:01.780
