00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.470
Microsoft Word's ability to
track changes allows you to

aabf7439-a9b5-4ee3-9eaf-8c0980317ac9-1
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.841
freely make edits to a document,
and your collaborators will be

aabf7439-a9b5-4ee3-9eaf-8c0980317ac9-2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.160
able to see exactly what changes
you made tart by going to the

aabf7439-a9b5-4ee3-9eaf-8c0980317ac9-3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.320
Review tab and here click Track
Changes.

ec245bf9-bfb3-4d85-bd48-196466d84893-0
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.412
With that enabled, Word will
track any changes you or anyone

ec245bf9-bfb3-4d85-bd48-196466d84893-1
00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:17.920
else makes to the document O.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.316
For example, I might highlight
some text here and make that

c88ec6d9-deb9-4f19-a80c-1f34b67e557b-1
00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:21.600
bold.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.931
I see a misselling down here
which I'll fix changing that A

24e5aa45-1bfc-4e83-bb6a-7e0e1ab1c865-1
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:31.017
to an O and maybe down here I
will create a

24e5aa45-1bfc-4e83-bb6a-7e0e1ab1c865-2
00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:32.380
made to the document.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.499
You can come back to the review
tab and notice here we have this

f9e808c1-f297-418a-bec2-d2e269a24a36-1
00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:37.340
menu that's currently set to
simple markup.

a59e917f-b172-4f9b-9a97-af5ab093baa7-0
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.180
We have several options here.

77f720f9-5e0f-4ba4-a8f2-a8a44d128431-0
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.209
The simle markup option
indicates where changes have

77f720f9-5e0f-4ba4-a8f2-a8a44d128431-1
00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.180
been made with a red line in the
margin O.

df077d99-13de-4b5c-a7e4-1e23cf1e8ed1-0
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.744
You might have noticed that as I
made my changes these red lines

df077d99-13de-4b5c-a7e4-1e23cf1e8ed1-1
00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:47.100
appeared.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.255
All markup shows the edits with
a blue highlight and you can

37e9a64d-d8a9-432e-b963-1229d3747cd7-1
00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:54.780
actually see the changes here in
the document.

61057584-e0c3-4f28-b742-7a13ad77b3cc-0
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.271
Now in this first case, at the
top you can see that the change

61057584-e0c3-4f28-b742-7a13ad77b3cc-1
00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:00.040
is that the font was changed to
bold.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.210
Down here you can see that the A
was deleted and the O was tyed

3c910c01-551f-44d3-94ff-fa667e089588-1
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.107
in its place, and here we can
see another line indicating a

3c910c01-551f-44d3-94ff-fa667e089588-2
00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:07.880
paragraph break.

ad8ef91b-01c0-41d4-b7b0-e42c811c1645-0
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.191
There's also the option here of
no markup which hides all the

ad8ef91b-01c0-41d4-b7b0-e42c811c1645-1
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:15.241
Markus and shows you what the
changes will look like in the

ad8ef91b-01c0-41d4-b7b0-e42c811c1645-2
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.392
document and original shows the
document in its original form

ad8ef91b-01c0-41d4-b7b0-e42c811c1645-3
00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:21.391
without the changes, which can
be useful for comparing the

ad8ef91b-01c0-41d4-b7b0-e42c811c1645-4
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.119
original with the edited
version.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.709
Additionally, when you're
viewing an option that displays

a37035ca-9646-426a-9686-66b2d00ca04d-1
00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:29.843
the markups, you can use the
Show Marku menu here to secify

a37035ca-9646-426a-9686-66b2d00ca04d-2
00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:32.090
which tyes of revisions you want
to see O.

af48b2f5-f432-4954-848b-cd969829aa03-0
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.981
For example, if you only wanted
to see formatting changes, you

af48b2f5-f432-4954-848b-cd969829aa03-1
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:37.780
could uncheck everything but
that option and now you can see

af48b2f5-f432-4954-848b-cd969829aa03-2
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.580
I'm only seeing the change here
where I changed this text to

af48b2f5-f432-4954-848b-cd969829aa03-3
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.809
bold.

3179f739-2c6f-4fb6-85fa-2db4cbb670b2-0
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.167
But if I want to see the other
changes I can add, insert and

3179f739-2c6f-4fb6-85fa-2db4cbb670b2-1
00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:46.780
deletions back and if I have
comments I can see those as

3179f739-2c6f-4fb6-85fa-2db4cbb670b2-2
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.010
well.

3fd1c40a-e02f-4c04-a327-cc3a25b1d529-0
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.010
O That's how to track changes to
documents in Word.
