00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.530
On your computer, your web
browser is the software you need

e04dd739-7bed-40f4-9fec-6a0707a5ed68-1
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.040
in order to access and interact
with the content.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.106
On the web, most oerating
systems come with at least one

0e75577b-bce3-48a3-90ee-4de98d45911b-1
00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:10.720
builtin web browser alication.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.439
For example, Mac O computers
include the Afari browser and

71d1f214-4243-4d2c-807f-db9deac91cfb-1
00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.440
Windows 10 includes Microsoft
Edge.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.668
But there are several other
browsers on the market to choose

8aca9a58-7e1a-4901-b99d-70b155ff3294-1
00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:22.000
from, including Google Chrome
and Mozilla Firefox.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.239
At the most basic level, all
browsers allow you to access

85c25f5f-f10b-4703-9c87-b0f79d51ecf9-1
00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.802
websites, download files, images
and videos on websites, and so

85c25f5f-f10b-4703-9c87-b0f79d51ecf9-2
00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:29.970
on.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.526
Browsers mainly vary in the
features they include, but these

24fcf460-d937-47a9-954e-503055057ac2-1
00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:35.650
days most browsers have very
similar features.

86ad1070-d399-433f-bd76-e1f3530e5fd5-0
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.615
Here we'll take a look at
browsing the web with Microsoft

86ad1070-d399-433f-bd76-e1f3530e5fd5-1
00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:41.137
Edge, but you'll be able to use
other modern browsers in mostly

86ad1070-d399-433f-bd76-e1f3530e5fd5-2
00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:41.650
the same way.

7c113c21-4fb9-43d3-9cb8-c672d224bbd9-0
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.890
I'll open U Microsoft Edge, and
there it is.

b9a2fa05-0043-449e-833f-dcdc538c0586-0
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.581
To access a website, we enter
the URL or address of the site

b9a2fa05-0043-449e-833f-dcdc538c0586-1
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.810
into the address bar at the top
of the window.

c9f4a1c1-2794-4ab0-b69c-96e6bc61117d-0
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.357
The browser loads the web page
and it's dislayed in the main

c9f4a1c1-2794-4ab0-b69c-96e6bc61117d-1
00:00:54.357 --> 00:00:55.070
part of the window.

25a7d6e9-5628-40df-a293-3b1a7668f0ba-0
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.880
We can use the scroll bar to
Scroll down the page, to view it

25a7d6e9-5628-40df-a293-3b1a7668f0ba-1
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.830
and to interact with all the
elements on the page.

cd73b3a9-718c-4e50-b707-abbfc8a63b3d-0
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.710
Webages usually contain
hyperlinks, often just called

cd73b3a9-718c-4e50-b707-abbfc8a63b3d-1
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.924
links that point to other pages
on the website or to entirely

cd73b3a9-718c-4e50-b707-abbfc8a63b3d-2
00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:07.910
different websites.

8ed39fc7-5d6d-4cd7-8474-46d6214d08bc-0
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.470
You can often tell if text is a
hyperlink by its appearance.

9a321f37-5e14-4040-a8d8-f103397d4ed8-0
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.617
It's usually a different color
from the surrounding text, like

9a321f37-5e14-4040-a8d8-f103397d4ed8-1
00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:16.885
we see here, or it becomes
underlined or already is

9a321f37-5e14-4040-a8d8-f103397d4ed8-2
00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:19.415
underlined, or it's just
visually different in some other

9a321f37-5e14-4040-a8d8-f103397d4ed8-3
00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:19.590
way.

4cc6af2d-c318-449f-98ac-1cc4052f5f31-0
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.143
Alternately, if you place your
mouse over text or an image and

4cc6af2d-c318-449f-98ac-1cc4052f5f31-1
00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:25.511
the cursor turns into a hand
with a ointing finger that

4cc6af2d-c318-449f-98ac-1cc4052f5f31-2
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.879
indicates the item is a
clickable link, you'll also see

4cc6af2d-c318-449f-98ac-1cc4052f5f31-3
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.458
the address that clicking the
link will take you to there in

4cc6af2d-c318-449f-98ac-1cc4052f5f31-4
00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:31.600
the lower left hand corner.

ab83eb83-05a1-40b3-a420-8fe3f6772a43-0
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.888
And if I click that link, I'll
go to that page and now we're

ab83eb83-05a1-40b3-a420-8fe3f6772a43-1
00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:37.497
looking at the webage that was
linked from the previous page

ab83eb83-05a1-40b3-a420-8fe3f6772a43-2
00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.079
and we can start browsing this
page.

a4dd9098-a1b8-44f9-8ae5-88b28446c8c5-0
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.720
If necessary, you can go back to
the previous page by clicking

a4dd9098-a1b8-44f9-8ae5-88b28446c8c5-1
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.960
the back button in the browser.

babb4c13-54f2-4791-baeb-e97831e4adb7-0
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.467
Imilarly, you can click the
forward button to view that

babb4c13-54f2-4791-baeb-e97831e4adb7-1
00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:48.120
linked age again.

136cc9ee-f236-4311-9c01-32e2d5775d72-0
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.539
Although it's easy to move back
and forth between ages like

136cc9ee-f236-4311-9c01-32e2d5775d72-1
00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.258
this, there are often times when
you need to reference multile

136cc9ee-f236-4311-9c01-32e2d5775d72-2
00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.804
webages at the same time, and
going back and forth can get

136cc9ee-f236-4311-9c01-32e2d5775d72-3
00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:57.150
tedious.

078f531f-2b65-48af-9210-572b2df0ac48-0
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.887
A solution is to use tabs, which
are a feature of web browsers

078f531f-2b65-48af-9210-572b2df0ac48-1
00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.952
that allow you to open multiple
webages at the same time in the

078f531f-2b65-48af-9210-572b2df0ac48-2
00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:04.910
same browser window.

ad2aa740-8334-46f3-8928-29c2e8710989-0
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.430
For example, maybe I'm searching
for Microsoft Surface tablets.

8071e2f6-19a9-4e28-9d92-0c1de0ae0217-0
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.706
I'll click that link and as you
can see, there are many

8071e2f6-19a9-4e28-9d92-0c1de0ae0217-1
00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:13.550
different models to choose from
here.

61e6faa4-b6ba-4f9c-8df9-6236acc0d110-0
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.473
Clicking one of these takes me
to the page about that model and

61e6faa4-b6ba-4f9c-8df9-6236acc0d110-1
00:02:17.473 --> 00:02:20.336
then I need to click the back
button to go back to the links

61e6faa4-b6ba-4f9c-8df9-6236acc0d110-2
00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:21.650
to look at the other models.

2b95559b-73b3-4a74-a980-645a8eaaf7f7-0
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.598
To save time, I'm going to
rightclick on the link and

2b95559b-73b3-4a74-a980-645a8eaaf7f7-1
00:02:25.598 --> 00:02:28.696
choose Open link in new tab in
this particular browser that

2b95559b-73b3-4a74-a980-645a8eaaf7f7-2
00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:31.742
opens a new tab here in the
background and you can see the

2b95559b-73b3-4a74-a980-645a8eaaf7f7-3
00:02:31.742 --> 00:02:32.930
title of the page here.

c7348b67-b3a8-458b-8934-80b6f2574c9e-0
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.232
In some web browsers deending on
your settings, the new tab may

c7348b67-b3a8-458b-8934-80b6f2574c9e-1
00:02:36.232 --> 00:02:38.890
open in the front, but in either
case you can switch back and

c7348b67-b3a8-458b-8934-80b6f2574c9e-2
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.690
forth between tabs just by
clicking them.

3c42e089-fd01-4339-a2ed-e65c7286a6d3-0
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.600
O Now I can rightclick on the
links for the other product

3c42e089-fd01-4339-a2ed-e65c7286a6d3-1
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.370
versions I'm interested in and
open them in new tabs as well.

0e5ce1c7-e31e-463c-81fa-15afcfa9bdc6-0
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.785
And once I've done that, I can
now switch among all the tabs to

0e5ce1c7-e31e-463c-81fa-15afcfa9bdc6-1
00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:54.370
do my research.

a286b7bf-eaa4-4e85-b85e-a03f449183fb-0
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.506
You can also oen webages in new
Windows by rightclicking and

a286b7bf-eaa4-4e85-b85e-a03f449183fb-1
00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:02.210
choosing Open link in new
window.

050f8bdc-300b-4596-a983-c9351e6a90d3-0
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.114
Opening links in new Windows can
help you stay organized by

050f8bdc-300b-4596-a983-c9351e6a90d3-1
00:03:06.114 --> 00:03:08.954
grouing related tabs in their
own window and opening unrelated

050f8bdc-300b-4596-a983-c9351e6a90d3-2
00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.434
tabs in other windows, but
that's a matter of personal

050f8bdc-300b-4596-a983-c9351e6a90d3-3
00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:11.930
preference.

4df3c4f5-9756-426f-91d2-fcadd9072f3b-0
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.323
But because these are searate
windows, I can move this one

4df3c4f5-9756-426f-91d2-fcadd9072f3b-1
00:03:14.323 --> 00:03:16.756
slightly out of the way and
still see the other window here

4df3c4f5-9756-426f-91d2-fcadd9072f3b-2
00:03:16.756 --> 00:03:19.150
in the background and I can
switch to that if I needed to.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.642
You can always Kee track of the

history feature of the browser.

over history and from here I can

00:03:31.055 --> 00:03:34.594
choose Manage History to see a

organized by date.

17f7fe4b-4209-4768-916a-f9124ac37996-0
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.665
You have the option to clear web
ages from your history whenever

17f7fe4b-4209-4768-916a-f9124ac37996-1
00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:40.950

49dda31d-5ca5-46f0-a193-602ee0872bb1-0
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.752
Here, I could choose to clear
the browsing history from the

49dda31d-5ca5-46f0-a193-602ee0872bb1-1
00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:47.445

four weeks, and all of my
browsing history.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.220
I'll leave that as is for now,
though.

a813a877-0d24-4ae4-a877-8aca838956f7-0
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.768
Again, you'll find all the
features we've seen here in

00:03:54.768 --> 00:03:57.634

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.414
But once you've familiarized
yourself with your preferred
