00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.274
Before you start using Kye to
make calls, you should make sure

e009b701-509d-4507-8b6b-e14808b1df92-1
00:00:03.274 --> 00:00:05.802
your audio and video settings
are configured properly so

e009b701-509d-4507-8b6b-e14808b1df92-2
00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.000
others can hear or see you.

e9a4e0ef-d403-4bb9-9677-0b6720135bd9-0
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.867
You should always confirm your
settings before making or

e9a4e0ef-d403-4bb9-9677-0b6720135bd9-1
00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:10.520
receiving a call.

dd40f1f7-f426-4259-ac75-025e3ab7f476-0
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.203
You don't want to be fumbling
around with your settings during

dd40f1f7-f426-4259-ac75-025e3ab7f476-1
00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:15.760
a call, esecially if it's an
important or rofessional call.

bdb57161-c7f8-4005-9fb6-1fe518a3ada4-0
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.145
Here in Kye, start by clicking
this three dot button and

bdb57161-c7f8-4005-9fb6-1fe518a3ada4-1
00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:25.592
selecting Settings and then
select Audio and Video and here

bdb57161-c7f8-4005-9fb6-1fe518a3ada4-2
00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:27.519
at the top next to Camera.

bd3cd305-1532-42da-985a-a40d3010bc36-0
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.002
If you have multile cameras
connected to your computer you

bd3cd305-1532-42da-985a-a40d3010bc36-1
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.230
can choose the one you want to
use.

75b6e2a9-b48e-4832-83d1-3eae991d96ed-0
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.083
In Kye I'm using a Surface
tablet so I have both a front

75b6e2a9-b48e-4832-83d1-3eae991d96ed-1
00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:37.336
facing camera and a rear facing
camera, but for Kye calls I most

75b6e2a9-b48e-4832-83d1-3eae991d96ed-2
00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.990
likely want to keep my front
facing camera selected.

c63c74b2-551f-4ffe-9b4e-d936e1663ee3-0
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.213
Once you've selected your camera
you can Scroll down to your

c63c74b2-551f-4ffe-9b4e-d936e1663ee3-1
00:00:43.213 --> 00:00:43.750
audio settings.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.034
Here next to Microphone you can
choose the microphone you want

2f72c6d0-4773-43db-9d59-5eeebd7c2274-1
00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:47.310
to use.

7d9fc73c-e2bb-4c54-9daf-43d166e4bebc-0
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.429
This might be your computer's
default builtin microphone, or

7d9fc73c-e2bb-4c54-9daf-43d166e4bebc-1
00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.152
you may have connected a USB
microphone, or you might want to

7d9fc73c-e2bb-4c54-9daf-43d166e4bebc-2
00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.963
use a microphone built into an
external webcam you've connected

7d9fc73c-e2bb-4c54-9daf-43d166e4bebc-3
00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:56.710
to your computer.

520d4554-a65e-4b34-8da1-8eaf77fcdd17-0
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.914
Notice, as I'm speaking, we're
seeing this meter move and this

520d4554-a65e-4b34-8da1-8eaf77fcdd17-1
00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:03.092
is telling me the audio levels
that are going into the

520d4554-a65e-4b34-8da1-8eaf77fcdd17-2
00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:05.428
microphone, and Kye is actually
doing a pretty good job of

520d4554-a65e-4b34-8da1-8eaf77fcdd17-3
00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:06.220
keeing those levels.

856317e8-0992-4199-a3b9-176e394745eb-0
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.156
Even if you want, you can turn
this automatically adjust

856317e8-0992-4199-a3b9-176e394745eb-1
00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:12.041
microhone settings, switch off
and manually adjust your

856317e8-0992-4199-a3b9-176e394745eb-2
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:13.020
microhone settings.

7dafe69e-61c1-454e-9f9e-ed426a7979f4-0
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.961
Basically, you don't want the
levels getting all the way to

7dafe69e-61c1-454e-9f9e-ed426a7979f4-1
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.461
the right here, I'm just going
to leave it set to auto In this

7dafe69e-61c1-454e-9f9e-ed426a7979f4-2
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:18.660
case.

7c0dbce7-0edf-438b-a709-f5ef3f792647-0
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.097
Below that, you can choose the
speakers you want to use to

7c0dbce7-0edf-438b-a709-f5ef3f792647-1
00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:23.140
listen to audio through Kye.

0ca70033-e0a7-4fdc-a457-1522ed028b09-0
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.751
This could be your device's
builtin seakers, external

0ca70033-e0a7-4fdc-a457-1522ed028b09-1
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.840
seakers, a Bluetooth headset
you've aired to your computer an

0ca70033-e0a7-4fdc-a457-1522ed028b09-2
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.140
so on.

52da4dcd-9c36-478f-b4f9-434c68a83082-0
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.850
By clicking the test audio
button, you can check if the

52da4dcd-9c36-478f-b4f9-434c68a83082-1
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.660
audio is playing through your
selected seakers.

c77a3254-e535-42eb-a024-e9ed01b16158-0
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.447
Now if you don't hear anything,
double check to make sure you

c77a3254-e535-42eb-a024-e9ed01b16158-1
00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:44.068
have the right Seaker selected,
and then on your seakers or

c77a3254-e535-42eb-a024-e9ed01b16158-2
00:01:44.068 --> 00:01:46.820
headset themselves, make sure
they're turned on and not muted.

6d6f4a03-cb01-4060-a6ec-3ab85e9f6921-0
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.249
We can close settings and once
you have your video and audio

6d6f4a03-cb01-4060-a6ec-3ab85e9f6921-1
00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.060
settings configured, you're
ready to make a call.

7ef5d3a6-9402-45c9-8c1f-3c60c2495cfe-0
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.330
Let's try a video call.

68c0cac9-82de-4572-8070-c6a323801388-0
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.420
I'll come over here to my
contacts and I want to give my

68c0cac9-82de-4572-8070-c6a323801388-1
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.450
friend Nick a call.

aee5f378-7ebe-4fa7-95be-4bfc76225798-0
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.152
So I'll select his name and here
in the upper right hand corner I

aee5f378-7ebe-4fa7-95be-4bfc76225798-1
00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:05.130
could click the phone button to
make an audio call over Kye.

48add4ea-b5b9-4721-8d34-6ee458052ea0-0
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.298
But in this case, I'll click the
video camera icon to make a

48add4ea-b5b9-4721-8d34-6ee458052ea0-1
00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:13.330
video call and I can see myself
as a call is being placed.

fb1d4d26-63e4-4605-a193-fbe980686b97-0
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.610
And in a second there's Nick.

4c69a115-6d09-4599-8791-0c485baacbc2-0
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.930
Hey Nick.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.090
Hello.

b0deb96a-908f-4b05-aa0f-3b0f8d3158f4-0
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.050
Thanks for heling me out with
this.

53ee6694-aede-4efc-90d5-e1afaf3cb9af-0
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.598
No roblem O that's pretty much
all there is to making a video

53ee6694-aede-4efc-90d5-e1afaf3cb9af-1
00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:24.400
call in Skype.

0b00f1da-85b6-4619-b91e-c8d287957e5c-0
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.223
We can now both see and hear
each other and we can have a

0b00f1da-85b6-4619-b91e-c8d287957e5c-1
00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:29.810
conversation in Skye anytime we
like as long as we're both

0b00f1da-85b6-4619-b91e-c8d287957e5c-2
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.520
someplace with an Internet
connection.

92b9317e-6572-4d4c-b6a2-26d5d92df432-0
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.459
O at this point I want to show
what it looks like if we receive

92b9317e-6572-4d4c-b6a2-26d5d92df432-1
00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.040
a video call.

de830300-b12e-4728-8b91-566b5a4dc998-0
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.582
So Nick, I'm going to hang U but
could you call me back in just a

de830300-b12e-4728-8b91-566b5a4dc998-1
00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:39.160
couple seconds?

514144eb-e64a-426c-a2c0-7ec0324785df-0
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.600
No problem.

8bd5eb62-d7d1-472c-9b3d-21b1f0501438-0
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.800
Alright see you in a second.

1a6295ea-85dd-4c87-a9c4-3d723206e95f-0
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.152
Alright, so to receive a call
Skye needs to be running and now

1a6295ea-85dd-4c87-a9c4-3d723206e95f-1
00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:48.640
we can see Nick is calling.

d3dadb8b-0806-40ed-9c87-351230414623-0
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.532
Now I could click the hone
button if I only wanted to

d3dadb8b-0806-40ed-9c87-351230414623-1
00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:54.034
answer with audio or I could
hang U if I didn't want to

d3dadb8b-0806-40ed-9c87-351230414623-2
00:02:54.034 --> 00:02:54.660

dc6fb19c-31d7-4d87-8c3d-9832bc1fadef-0
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.580
But in this case, I will answer
with the video button again.

09f7530b-b6a8-4dbe-9823-08aa84458005-0
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420
And once again, there's Nick.

b26ce822-c208-40af-9e00-1190827c064a-0
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.020
Hello again.

f40bfd9e-801e-4539-8a40-59610eb9bd64-0
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.540
O.

d70bcd0a-54f8-4a8d-853d-bba5bfed45d5-0
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.220
That's pretty much it.

a4232d6f-de29-4663-8525-0ea727f6650e-0
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.931
We can now just continue having
our normal conversation here

a4232d6f-de29-4663-8525-0ea727f6650e-1
00:03:05.931 --> 00:03:06.420
over video.

3a2a68d2-5a4e-4444-9a5e-2fe1fd53e1af-0
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.220
All right.

d41976d5-ad9c-42a2-ac1a-87d603423363-0
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.980
So thanks again, Nick.

4ad2cb31-6437-4ffc-8975-ff9fa6524486-0
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.940
All right, I'll talk to you
later.

834016a2-1e11-4913-9b98-0b3be1aa3a03-0
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.620
OK.

20cb9f65-f936-41c6-89f5-4be9275fd07e-0
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.365
So that's how you set U your
audio and video settings so you

20cb9f65-f936-41c6-89f5-4be9275fd07e-1
00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:16.940
can make and receive calls in
Kye.
