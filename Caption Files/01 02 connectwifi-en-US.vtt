00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.693
Wi-Fi networks allow you to get
online without the use of a

40f988c2-3a69-410f-9493-1ef2afd7c8f0-1
00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:06.931
wired Ethernet connection in
places like your home, Oregon

40f988c2-3a69-410f-9493-1ef2afd7c8f0-2
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.950
office, or in hotels,
restaurants, shopping malls, and

40f988c2-3a69-410f-9493-1ef2afd7c8f0-3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.279
so on.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.490
Let's take a look at how to
connect to a Wi-Fi network on a

ac293813-7707-41ea-9bff-531c1deb0d58-1
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.320
Windows 10 computer.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.938
The first step is to check your
Wi-Fi status, which you can see

56663434-5a37-4318-939f-16f4fb8ce1ec-1
00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:20.393
in the right hand side of the
taskbar at the bottom of your

56663434-5a37-4318-939f-16f4fb8ce1ec-2
00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:20.680
screen.

949dda9b-9215-40e6-acea-fc1c249c88ec-0
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.234
Notice this icon that looks like
a globe, which you can think of

949dda9b-9215-40e6-acea-fc1c249c88ec-1
00:00:24.234 --> 00:00:25.760
as representing the World Wide
Web.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.648
If I roll my mouse over, that
icon can see a message telling

eb4382ac-a4cb-4427-a91d-f56e43226694-1
00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:32.752
me I'm not currently connected
to a network and it says no

eb4382ac-a4cb-4427-a91d-f56e43226694-2
00:00:32.752 --> 00:00:34.119
connections are available.

682a7cb6-267f-4b59-9b59-3515c112d7f0-0
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.572
Now I know for a fact that there
are Wi-Fi networks where I am

682a7cb6-267f-4b59-9b59-3515c112d7f0-1
00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:40.644
right now, so this robably means
that the Wi-Fi on my computer is

682a7cb6-267f-4b59-9b59-3515c112d7f0-2
00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:42.600
turned off, so I need to turn it
back on.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.370
And I can do that simly by
clicking this icon and here I'll

7131c3e0-05db-4a38-8a1c-3b0ff715539e-1
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.621
click Wi-Fi O I've reenabled
Wi-Fi on my computer and now I

7131c3e0-05db-4a38-8a1c-3b0ff715539e-2
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.872
see a list of nearby Wi-Fi
networks along with their signal

7131c3e0-05db-4a38-8a1c-3b0ff715539e-3
00:00:52.872 --> 00:00:53.360
strength.

c2570ddb-690c-43de-bc61-b22f9e9ac1ee-0
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.349
The more bars you see in the
icon next to the network, the

c2570ddb-690c-43de-bc61-b22f9e9ac1ee-1
00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:57.240
stronger the connection.

b5fadc40-8b51-4bb0-9211-fee418616510-0
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.580
Generally, the stronger the
connection, the faster and more

b5fadc40-8b51-4bb0-9211-fee418616510-1
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.350
consistent the Wi-Fi erformance
will be.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.996
O You can see I only have a
couple bars down on this network

e223e218-e25d-41c0-a33e-fb1631a28b71-1
00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:09.109
here, a few more here, but here
at the top we see full strength

e223e218-e25d-41c0-a33e-fb1631a28b71-2
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.790
Wi-Fi signals.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.087
In most cases you'll want to
connect to a network whose name

062b1266-e8af-4582-b702-a7d053aee697-1
00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:13.670
you recognize.

45acb16a-d3f6-4b0e-8a63-8cadd6048002-0
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.521
This might be your home Oregon
office network or a network in

45acb16a-d3f6-4b0e-8a63-8cadd6048002-1
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:17.950
the coffee shop you're sitting
in.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.693
You'll also usually see the word
secured under the Wi-Fi network

a9b7d655-d2a7-49bb-8411-6f5688472531-1
00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:24.310
name, indicating that the
network is password protected.

c1a7b9a3-f619-448e-9770-ee9e58a28604-0
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.656
You can connect to networks that
are labeled open, but they'll

c1a7b9a3-f619-448e-9770-ee9e58a28604-1
00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:30.167
often be set U with other
security measures that require

c1a7b9a3-f619-448e-9770-ee9e58a28604-2
00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.767
you to validate your identity
before allowing you to fully

c1a7b9a3-f619-448e-9770-ee9e58a28604-3
00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:33.120
connect.

32d39be4-09f0-454f-ad22-f43b681a06be-0
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.407
As a rule of thumb, you
shouldn't connect to unknown

32d39be4-09f0-454f-ad22-f43b681a06be-1
00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:38.996
networks as a matter of
etiquette, but also for security

32d39be4-09f0-454f-ad22-f43b681a06be-2
00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:39.359
reasons.

0731a91a-36d6-4aea-8fb0-fe602f33b7dd-0
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.406
O in this case, I do know that
this one in articular is a

0731a91a-36d6-4aea-8fb0-fe602f33b7dd-1
00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:43.800
trusted network, so I'll
selected it.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.654
If I want to automatically
connect to this network in the

0c0d9f06-44f1-4f81-9320-a14aa409a39f-1
00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:50.318
future, I'll make sure Connect
Automatically is checked and

0c0d9f06-44f1-4f81-9320-a14aa409a39f-2
00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:53.160
then I'll click Connect and I'm
prompted to enter the password.

ae2bb950-f9f8-43dc-bbae-fa219b47dfb6-0
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.865
If you're connecting to your own
network, you should know the

ae2bb950-f9f8-43dc-bbae-fa219b47dfb6-1
00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.190
password.

c66b548b-b50c-4837-ba0b-60757ea89f61-0
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.400
If you're connecting to a Wi-Fi
network at a business or a shop,

c66b548b-b50c-4837-ba0b-60757ea89f61-1
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.950
you may have to ask for the
password.

cc80ed1e-b50c-4d5a-a439-fe8a0bb95d0b-0
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.361
For security, the password is
dislayed as dots, but if you

cc80ed1e-b50c-4d5a-a439-fe8a0bb95d0b-1
00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:07.324
want, you can check that you're
typing it correctly by clicking

cc80ed1e-b50c-4d5a-a439-fe8a0bb95d0b-2
00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:09.917
and holding on this eye icon,
and when you release that

cc80ed1e-b50c-4d5a-a439-fe8a0bb95d0b-3
00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:11.630
button, it'll go back to being
dots.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.399
Once you enter the password,
click Next, deending on how your

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.254
You may see this message asking
if you want your computer to be

00:02:19.254 --> 00:02:20.870
seen by other computers on the
network.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.952
If you're connecting to your
home Oregon office network,

68b33e36-e2a6-4433-b1be-0dfc2bd55829-1
00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:24.370
click yes.

e0b3fa83-ee2b-412b-8070-4d08eabe448d-0
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.405
Being able to see other comuters
on your network makes it easy to

e0b3fa83-ee2b-412b-8070-4d08eabe448d-1
00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:28.490
transfer files between them.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.429
And now I see the message that
I'm connected to my Wi-Fi
