00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.187
Thanks to the Internet, we can
store information online from

397ab2c8-242c-4248-8c6e-3642066368aa-1
00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:07.520
one device and access it from
another device almost instantly.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.064
This is commonly referred to as
storing Information in the

9d7b45bc-5599-406b-addd-818be445f019-1
00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:11.360
cloud.

916eb3fe-bac2-4516-aafc-eabd80a23650-0
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.827
The cloud is basically a
collection of software services

916eb3fe-bac2-4516-aafc-eabd80a23650-1
00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:17.440
that are running in multiple
locations on the Internet

916eb3fe-bac2-4516-aafc-eabd80a23650-2
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.720
instead of running on a single
user's computer.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.616
That means that the storing
content in the cloud makes it

0e01e231-8e60-4fd1-93c9-1a6fa4172b43-1
00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:26.812
easy to access your information
from any device in any location

0e01e231-8e60-4fd1-93c9-1a6fa4172b43-2
00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:28.360
where you have Internet access.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.688
Some cloud based services you
might have heard of include

50806bd7-d0c6-404c-9ab9-0e52f63e9995-1
00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:36.247
Dropbox, Apple's iCloud Drive,
Google Drive, and Microsoft

50806bd7-d0c6-404c-9ab9-0e52f63e9995-2
00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:36.790
OneDrive.

2484ae2d-8271-41c1-801d-ca49e817ab28-0
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.493
So, for example, instead of
saving your important documents

2484ae2d-8271-41c1-801d-ca49e817ab28-1
00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:43.118
and other files to your
computer, you can save them to

2484ae2d-8271-41c1-801d-ca49e817ab28-2
00:00:43.118 --> 00:00:46.030
OneDrive, which will allow you
to get to them from anywhere.

80a48b0c-0e60-44f4-88d3-4211e99fd753-0
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.342
This means that if you're
working on a file on your home

80a48b0c-0e60-44f4-88d3-4211e99fd753-1
00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.684
computer and save it to
OneDrive, and later you're on

80a48b0c-0e60-44f4-88d3-4211e99fd753-2
00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.417
the road with only your mobile
phone, you can still access and

80a48b0c-0e60-44f4-88d3-4211e99fd753-3
00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:56.630
download that file through
OneDrive on your phone.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.842
In this charter, we'll take a
look at how to save and access

a8f9d987-a91b-4911-b598-98a813d17b91-1
00:01:00.842 --> 00:01:03.850
files from OneDrive, but you'll
find that the process of doing

a8f9d987-a91b-4911-b598-98a813d17b91-2
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.810
so is very similar to working
with other Cloudbased services.
