00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.253
When logged into Kye, you and
your contacts can Kee track of

199e8975-ea56-4c55-8262-2074149f6292-1
00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:05.800
each other's availability with
the presence indicators.

501ffbbc-4bb9-4f4f-9089-dc36cdc6f520-0
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.077
You can set your own presence
status by clicking the colored

501ffbbc-4bb9-4f4f-9089-dc36cdc6f520-1
00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:10.000
dot next to your name.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.318
Active is green and means that
you're actively using your

62ede348-a123-45e6-b111-745721cb2dd2-1
00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:15.872
computer and are generally
available to receive messages

62ede348-a123-45e6-b111-745721cb2dd2-2
00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:16.320
and calls.

0de846d3-0396-4812-934c-add0118c3e2b-0
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.629
This doesn't mean that you have
to receive and reply to messages

0de846d3-0396-4812-934c-add0118c3e2b-1
00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:22.178
right away, but it's a good idea
to set your status to let your

0de846d3-0396-4812-934c-add0118c3e2b-2
00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:24.568
friends and coworkers know your
availability so they have a

0de846d3-0396-4812-934c-add0118c3e2b-3
00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:26.680
better idea of when they might
get a reply from you.

e436e816-6de3-4d4b-8147-a09c581e0556-0
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.647
O You can set your status to
Away if you're away from your

e436e816-6de3-4d4b-8147-a09c581e0556-1
00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:33.866
computer in a meeting an so on
which turns your icon yellow and

e436e816-6de3-4d4b-8147-a09c581e0556-2
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.884
that lets your contacts know
that you may not respond right

e436e816-6de3-4d4b-8147-a09c581e0556-3
00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:39.600
away, but that you're still able
to receive messages.

bdd7f3b6-f9a6-4bb6-8fad-cee5c64b2d42-0
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.485
And Do Not Disturb not only
turns the presence indicator

bdd7f3b6-f9a6-4bb6-8fad-cee5c64b2d42-1
00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:46.203
red, but it will also mute
notifications about incoming

bdd7f3b6-f9a6-4bb6-8fad-cee5c64b2d42-2
00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:46.639
messages.

f6e9709f-5015-4b76-bb0d-15f4fe86efb0-0
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.877
O You truly won't be disturbed
by people trying to text or call

f6e9709f-5015-4b76-bb0d-15f4fe86efb0-1
00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:50.040
you.

1147884b-f046-41c9-81a7-b662a63dc7cc-0
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.072
Your contacts will still see
that you're logged into Kye, but

1147884b-f046-41c9-81a7-b662a63dc7cc-1
00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:55.625
the red indicator will let them
know that you aren't receiving

1147884b-f046-41c9-81a7-b662a63dc7cc-2
00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:56.760
notifications at the moment.

a987947b-76ec-482f-9f6a-5193d48cd56e-0
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.690
And for times when you want to
remain on Kye but not show U as

a987947b-76ec-482f-9f6a-5193d48cd56e-1
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.740
online, you can choose the
invisible option.

31729f44-fee4-4034-8871-b4ed4b213e15-0
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.740
I'll set mine back to active.

931b4949-f90c-4482-853a-6f373122c6e2-0
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.345
Now, regardless of someone's
presence indicator, you can send

931b4949-f90c-4482-853a-6f373122c6e2-1
00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:11.110
them a text message at anytime
by clicking their name in your

931b4949-f90c-4482-853a-6f373122c6e2-2
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.340
contact list and then just start
tying a message.

f4107034-3308-4c52-871f-9f31de991540-0
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.420
I'll ress enter to send that
message to Jade.

59a0fde7-d6d0-4331-aa61-655891b39e4c-0
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.233
Now when I see Jade's icon or
initials appear below that

59a0fde7-d6d0-4331-aa61-655891b39e4c-1
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:25.141
message, that tells me that
she's seen the message and

59a0fde7-d6d0-4331-aa61-655891b39e4c-2
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.154
notice that when she starts
replying, see a message here

59a0fde7-d6d0-4331-aa61-655891b39e4c-3
00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.644
that Jade is typing and now I've
received a reply from Jade and I

59a0fde7-d6d0-4331-aa61-655891b39e4c-4
00:01:31.644 --> 00:01:32.860
can again reply to her.

2713cb06-0420-47e6-ba83-8cb8ec8c2c99-0
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.218
Now I can see that Jade has set
her status to away, so I know

2713cb06-0420-47e6-ba83-8cb8ec8c2c99-1
00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:41.220
that I might not receive a reply
right away.

df495f04-df92-433f-afd9-7b9b89729ee4-0
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.712
OI can just leave Kye running to
check in with my other contacts

df495f04-df92-433f-afd9-7b9b89729ee4-1
00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:47.516
or while I do other work on my
computer and that's how to have

df495f04-df92-433f-afd9-7b9b89729ee4-2
00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:48.940
a textbased conversation in Kye.
