00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Instructor] If you're going to build a house,

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:03,000
you need to know the difference

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,003
between a hammer and a screwdriver.

4
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:07,005
Getting to know your tools ahead of time

5
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:11,001
saves you headaches in the long run on any project.

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,008
In this lesson, I'll show you how to launch Power Automate

7
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:19,000
so that you can confidently navigate it to create flows.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,002
Let's talk about structure.

9
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,008
Power Automate processes are known as flows.

10
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:29,003
These can be described as when this happens, do something.

11
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:33,001
A connector is a connection to a service or product

12
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,002
like Outlook or forms.

13
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:39,000
Connectors contain triggers and actions.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,006
A trigger is the when this happens part.

15
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:46,005
An action is the do something part.

16
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,005
Together, they build a flow.

17
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,003
Now that you understand the relationship

18
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:53,006
between a connector and trigger,

19
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:56,005
I want to show you how to create a flow.

20
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,008
In the top left corner of office.com,

21
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:03,005
I'll select the app launcher and open Power Automate.

22
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:06,000
Here on the Power Automate homepage,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,004
you can see a list of different templates and tutorials

24
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:10,004
for getting started.

25
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:15,001
Power Automate provides three options for creating a flow.

26
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:19,002
I can see these by selecting create on the left side.

27
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:22,008
First, you can start from blank.

28
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,007
You might use this when you already know

29
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,006
what connectors and actions you need.

30
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,007
You also have the option to create a flow

31
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,002
by starting from a template.

32
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:35,000
These are commonly used in popular templates,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,005
which could help you solve a task you have already.

34
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,001
Or, you can start from a connector.

35
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,004
You can use this when you know

36
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:45,001
what service you want to create an automation around

37
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:49,000
but are unsure what actions may be available to use.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,001
The flows you've created are kept in the My Flows tab.

39
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,000
As you get more comfortable with Power Automate's layout,

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
you'll be able to quickly activate flows

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and improve your productivity.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,003
So dive in and start exploring flow templates

43
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,002
that will eliminate repetitive tasks out of your workday.
