00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,008
- [Narrator] Gathering feedback is a vital part

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,005
of any business workflow.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:09,006
In this lesson, I'll show you how to share Power BI reports

4
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,000
with your team.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,004
It's time to tell your story with data.

6
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,009
The easiest way to share your data with stakeholders

7
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:20,005
and collaborators is through exporting a PDF.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,001
You can install Power BI on your PC

9
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:27,006
by going to the Microsoft Store and searching for Power BI.

10
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,007
Once I have a Power BI report ready to distribute,

11
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:32,009
I'll export the file.

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,000
In the upper left menu, I'll select File, Export

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,005
and Export to PDF.

14
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:44,002
Power BI exports a PDF format of your data,

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,009
saving it to your downloads folder

16
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:50,002
and opening it in your PC's default PDF viewer.

17
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:53,003
Now I can use it like any other file.

18
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,007
I'll return to Power BI.

19
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,001
To make your reports accessible

20
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,004
by colleagues and customers online,

21
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,007
your organization will need to have a subscription

22
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:03,006
to Power BI.

23
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,006
To publish your reports to the cloud,

24
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,005
you'll need to sign into your Microsoft 365 account

25
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:18,007
with the button in the upper right corner of the screen.

26
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:21,003
Then to export the file to the web,

27
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,002
on the home ribbon, select Publish,

28
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:27,008
select My workspace and continue.

29
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:30,006
Power BI will begin publishing.

30
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,007
In the results window, select open in Power BI.

31
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,004
Power BI on the web opens,

32
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:40,002
and I can see the same report I created on the desktop.

33
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,007
I'm ready to share this report with my team,

34
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:45,006
so I'll select Share and then enter the names of the people

35
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:51,003
in my organization that I want to share it with.

36
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:52,005
I'll add a quick message

37
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:56,003
and then select Send.

38
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,006
Another advantage of having an online subscription

39
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:02,008
to Power BI is the ability to create dashboards.

40
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:05,006
While reports are a page of visualizations,

41
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:09,007
you can think of dashboards as a story based on reports.

42
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:11,005
I'll select Home on the left menu

43
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,000
and then I'll open a sample report

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,004
supplied by Power BI, the Sales and Returns Sample.

45
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,001
There are a few reports listed under pages.

46
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,003
Let's look at the net sales and returns.

47
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:25,003
Both reports have the Category Breakdown

48
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:27,008
and Store Breakdown visualization.

49
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to create a side by side report

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,008
with these three category breakdowns,

51
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:36,002
sales, returns and store.

52
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,007
Instead of recreating the visualization,

53
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,001
I can create a dashboard

54
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:44,003
by pinning the visualizations to a new dashboard.

55
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,008
In the upper right corner of each visualization,

56
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:49,002
select the pin icon.

57
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,005
The Pin to dashboard dialogue appears.

58
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,003
I can create a new dashboard and name it Sales Dashboard,

59
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,006
then select Pin.

60
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:01,007
Now on the left menu, I'll select Workspaces,

61
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:05,009
My workspace, and select the Sales Dashboard.

62
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:09,009
This is where the visualization is pinned to the dashboard.

63
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,009
I could continue to add more visualizations

64
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,004
to this dashboard from other Power BI reports.

65
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:16,009
From here, you can tell a story

66
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,008
about product sales and profitability.

67
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,007
Power BI provides several options

68
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:24,001
to collaborate and review reports.

69
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:27,005
Try sharing your reports with colleagues for feedback.

70
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,003
Collaboration is essential to growth

71
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:32,003
and ensures that stakeholders have the chance

72
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,009
to sign off on the visualizations you create

73
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,008
before they are shared with the world.
