00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,005
- [Narrator] You may not realize it,

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,007
but forms are used all the time in your daily life.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:06,006
Everything from casting your vote

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,001
to filling out a feedback survey

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,001
from your favorite coffee brand,

6
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,000
forms are used to gather all kinds of data.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,001
In this lesson,

8
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,003
I'll show you how to use Microsoft Forms to make surveys,

9
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:18,009
quizzes, and sign up forms

10
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,006
to reveal any data you're looking for.

11
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,000
In the top left corner of office.com.,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll select the app launcher and open forms to get started.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,008
Surveys gather data from clients

14
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:32,009
and can inform you of opportunities to improve.

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,006
For example, I use a survey every semester

16
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,006
to gauge my effectiveness as a lecturer.

17
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:41,001
Another great way businesses can use forms is

18
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,000
to collect information.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,003
This is a t-shirt signup form.

20
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,007
Not only do you get information on a client's t-shirt size,

21
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,008
but you also get their contact information.

22
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:55,002
You can also use forms for event registration.

23
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,000
Having a single list of all the people

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,003
who are attending an event electronically is the best way

25
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,002
to stay organized.

26
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,002
By creating a survey

27
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:05,007
for all your company's event registrations,

28
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,007
you'll always be able to track down necessary information

29
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,007
like number of RSVPs and anything else you need

30
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,007
to create a seamless event.

31
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:16,000
While forms and surveys allow you to gather data,

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,003
you can also use quizzes to assess the knowledge

33
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:20,007
of your clients and coworkers.

34
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,004
Quizzes can be fun.

35
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:25,001
I've used this animal quiz icebreaker to engage

36
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,006
with my team at the start of a meeting.

37
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,005
You can easily assess quiz results

38
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,008
with the Microsoft Forms response tab.

39
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,006
Let's take a look at this animal quiz.

40
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,002
I can easily scroll through the results

41
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,006
to see which questions were the most difficult

42
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,001
and which were the easiest.

43
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,000
This is indicated on my screen by looking

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,008
for the questions that have the least number correct

45
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,004
or those that have the most number correct.

46
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,002
I can also see the results graphically for a quick glimpse

47
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:52,007
into how everyone is doing with the material.

48
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:55,005
You can also download the data in Excel or import the data

49
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:59,003
into your favorite reporting tool to do further analysis.

50
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,007
Microsoft Forms provide several opportunities

51
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:04,009
for you to gather information and assess data.

52
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,006
This week create a fun quiz

53
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:09,003
for your coworkers, clients, or students.

54
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,005
Getting data directly

55
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,003
from your audience can only serve to improve your work.
