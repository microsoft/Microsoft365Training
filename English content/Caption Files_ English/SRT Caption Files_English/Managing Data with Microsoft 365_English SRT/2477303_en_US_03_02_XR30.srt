00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,005
- [Instructor] Have you ever been given a table of data

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:06,004
and just thought, "Where do I even start to review this?"

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,001
I know I have.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,005
Luckily, PivotTables can help you

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,007
make sense of your data easily.

6
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:15,007
In this lesson, I'll show you how PivotTables

7
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:21,000
can simplify data and present it in an easy to read format.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,007
In the top left corner of office.com,

9
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:27,003
I'll select the app launcher and open Excel.

10
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:31,005
From here, I'll open the Test Sales Order spreadsheet.

11
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,004
You can follow along with this document

12
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,009
in your exercise files.

13
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,004
We have lots of good data in here.

14
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,004
Let's see what it looks like in a PivotTable.

15
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:44,003
There are two PivotTables in this workbook,

16
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:48,006
Pivot Table by Product and Pivot Table by Customer.

17
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,009
I'll select the Pivot Table by Product tab

18
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,002
near the bottom of the screen.

19
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:56,007
This table not only sorts the data by products,

20
00:00:56,007 --> 00:01:00,009
but also provides an overview of who purchased each product.

21
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,000
Since this table combines the customer

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and total spending per item data points,

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,003
I can easily see that the total sales

24
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:12,003
for AWC's Logo Cap was $277.

25
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:16,003
And that Eastside Department Store purchased the most.

26
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,002
Place your cursor inside the PivotTable

27
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:21,002
by selecting cell B3.

28
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,006
Then in the top ribbon select the PivotTable tab,

29
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:27,002
then select Field List.

30
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,001
In the PivotTable Fields panel

31
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,009
you can see the two columns selected under rows,

32
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,004
Product and Customer.

33
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:39,003
This corresponds to the two columns in A and B on the left.

34
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:41,009
There's also a column in Values,

35
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,006
Sum of LineTotal, which corresponds to column C

36
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:49,008
and aggregates customer product in the sum total.

37
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,002
Now let's look at the PivotTable that is sorted by customer

38
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:57,001
by selecting the Pivot Table by Customer tab at the bottom.

39
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:01,002
This shows the breakdown of items purchased by customer.

40
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:05,001
Here you see that Action Bicycle Specialists

41
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:11,004
purchased 10 AWC Logo Caps and spent $38 on Bike Wash.

42
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:14,007
In this table I can easily add and remove columns

43
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,002
by selecting and deselecting the headers

44
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:20,003
in the PivotTable Fields panel.

45
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:23,004
I'll select UnitPrice which will add unit price

46
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:28,003
to the PivotTable to show the individual price of each item.

47
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,001
The PivotTable function in Excel

48
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,007
is a great way to quickly sort and analyze

49
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:35,006
any data points you've been given.

50
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,007
Think about how you can introduce PivotTables

51
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:41,004
into your projects and in doing so, save yourself some time.
