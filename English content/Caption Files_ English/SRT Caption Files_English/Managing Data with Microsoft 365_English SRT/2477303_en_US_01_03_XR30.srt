00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] Creating custom forms

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,007
like surveys and quizzes is an efficient and organized way

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:07,008
to get the information you need from internal team members

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,007
and external collaborators.

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,004
In this lesson, I'll show you

6
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,009
how to collect information from your audience

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,007
by building a Microsoft Form using different question types.

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,006
In this example, I'm going to create a contact form

9
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,006
to drive new clients and vendors

10
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,005
to a wedding planning company.

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,008
In the top left corner of office.com,

12
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:31,004
I'll select the app launcher and open forms.

13
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:34,002
I'll select new form.

14
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:37,001
I'll start by adding a name and description.

15
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,008
I'll set the form title to

16
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:42,002
Wedding Planning Consulting Interest.

17
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,001
I want my client to feel welcome,

18
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,002
so I'll write a friendly description.

19
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:49,004
Thank you for your interest in Wedding Planning Consulting.

20
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,000
Please fill out the contact form

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,002
so we can make your wedding a memorable day.

22
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,001
It's important to preview your form

23
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,005
to make sure it appears as intended.

24
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:02,004
The preview button on the top right

25
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,000
allows me to see what the form looks like.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,009
Here you'll see that the form title and description

27
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:09,004
match what I typed in.

28
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:10,008
Below the description,

29
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:13,005
you'll notice this disclosure statement.

30
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:14,006
Hi, Demo.

31
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,001
When you submit this form,

32
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,004
the owner will see your name and email address.

33
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:23,001
By default, a form is created to collect information

34
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,001
from people in your organization.

35
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,005
To change the setting,

36
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:30,000
select the back button in the top left corner of the page

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,004
to go back to the form design window.

38
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:35,003
Select more form settings in the upper right corner

39
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,008
and select settings.

40
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:40,005
I'll switch who can fill out this form

41
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:45,003
to anyone can respond so that clients can access the form.

42
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:49,000
Now I'll go back to preview and the message is removed.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,006
Now that the form looks good,

44
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:54,005
I'll select back to continue creating my contact form.

45
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:57,008
Next, I'm going to add questions to the contact form

46
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,005
that will capture relevant information

47
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,009
about the future client

48
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,008
and the type of services they may be looking for.

49
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,001
A good place to start

50
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,006
is to ask for their contact information.

51
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:11,005
To add a new question, I'll select add new.

52
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:15,001
Here, I'm presented with four different question types.

53
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:19,003
Choice, text, rating, and date.

54
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:22,000
Choice is answering a multiple choice question.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,004
Text is a fill in the blank question.

56
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,009
Rating is giving an opinion on a scale.

57
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:30,000
And date is when you specify a date from a calendar.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,005
For contact information,

59
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:34,002
I'm going to create three text questions.

60
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:37,005
I'll select text and enter email address.

61
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:50,008
I'll do this again for first name and last name.

62
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:53,002
The next piece of information that would be helpful

63
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,004
is when the clients want to get married.

64
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:56,009
This type of data can be captured

65
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,009
with the choice question type.

66
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:03,009
I'll select add new, choice, and enter the text

67
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:07,003
when do you plan to get married?

68
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:11,001
In the options field, I'll enter these options.

69
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:14,007
Less than six months, six to 12 months,

70
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:20,003
more than one year, and I don't know.

71
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:22,007
As a wedding planner, I would also like to know

72
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:26,002
if the clients have already picked a wedding date.

73
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:30,000
You can have them enter it using the date question type.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,006
I'll select add new, date, and enter

75
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,004
if you've already picked a date, enter it here

76
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,003
as the question.

77
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:42,007
And lastly, let's find out how comfortable the clients are

78
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:45,000
at planning things on a scale.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,009
So, I'll select add new, rating, with the text

80
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:51,005
how comfortable are you planning events?

81
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:54,009
Five being the most comfortable.

82
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:59,005
I will then select the symbol dropdown and choose number.

83
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:03,000
In a matter of minutes, my interest form is taking shape.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,006
Microsoft Forms gives you the power

85
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:06,003
to intentionally gather information

86
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:09,000
from clients and coworkers alike.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,001
Take some time and explore the other options

88
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,002
in the input fields and consider how you can use them

89
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,008
to get the details you need.

90
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:16,007
You've got this!
