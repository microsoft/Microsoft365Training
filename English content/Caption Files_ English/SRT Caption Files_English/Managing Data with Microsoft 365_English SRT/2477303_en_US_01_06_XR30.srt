As business consultant and author, Ken Blanchard once said,

4
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:11,009
"None of us is as smart as all of us."

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,009
In this lesson, I'll show you how to share your form

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,004
with collaborators so that they can view,

7
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:20,009

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,002

00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:28,003

18
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,009

22
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,005

25
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:11,007

Now, two people have access Isaiah and myself.

27
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,001
