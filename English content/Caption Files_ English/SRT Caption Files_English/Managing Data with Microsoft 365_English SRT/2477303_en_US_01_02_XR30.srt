00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,004
- [Instructor] Just like ship captains use the stars,

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,004
having the skills to navigate through software

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,007
is key to getting where you want to go.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,005
In this lesson,

5
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:09,001
I'm going to walk you through the tools

6
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:10,005
that will keep you organized

7
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:14,000
as you create surveys and quizzes in Microsoft Forms.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Starting from the Microsoft 365 homepage,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,006
I'll go to the app launcher and open Forms.

10
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,001
Here, I can create a new form,

11
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,000
view my recent forms, pinned forms,

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,008
and forms shared with me.

13
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:30,005
If I scroll to the bottom,

14
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,004
there is the My Group's pane

15
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,002
where you can see the groups you're a member of

16
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,007
and the total number of forms in each group.

17
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:39,009
What's important here at the bottom of my forms,

18
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,007
is the All My Forms button.

19
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:44,006
This will bring me to a list

20
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,004
with a list of all the forms I've created here.

21
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:48,007
You'll see the forms I've created

22
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,005
and the number of responses.

23
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,008
On the My forms page,

24
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,004
you have the ability to group your forms

25
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,007
into collections to keep them organized together.

26
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,007
New Collection is located on the upper right.

27
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:02,004
I created one collection that has my surveys.

28
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:06,003
Forms also gives you the choice of viewing a list or a grid.

29
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,006
This option is in the top right corner of your screen.

30
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,005
I like grid view

31
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,008
because I usually set a theme for each form,

32
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:15,002
making them easy to recognize and find.

33
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,009
With List View,

34
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,001
I can see all the forms I've created.

35
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,007
I can delete a form by clicking the More Options

36
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:27,006
in the lower right corner of a card and selecting delete.

37
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll confirm by clicking delete.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,004
If you need to restore a form that you've already deleted,

39
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:37,007
not to worry, you can get it back from the recycle bin

40
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,008
in the lower right corner.

41
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:41,008
Now you're ready to use Microsoft Forms

42
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:45,004
to choose the right tools to quickly navigate to your forms.

43
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,007
Try it out by logging into Microsoft 365,

44
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,003
go into the Forms app, and making your first form.
