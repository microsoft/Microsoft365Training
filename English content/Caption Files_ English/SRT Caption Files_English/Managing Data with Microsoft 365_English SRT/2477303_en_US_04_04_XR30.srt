00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] Imagine you're staring at a table

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,007
in Excel and attempting to make sense

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:07,000
of the relationships between several sheets.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,009
Working with data

5
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,008
means dealing with the variety of formats

6
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,005
it appears in.

7
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,007
In this lesson, I'll show you

8
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:16,007
how to use Power BI's intelligent import tool

9
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,009
to assist you in creating relationships

10
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,007
between several sources of data.

11
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,001
You'll be able to join data

12
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:25,008
to make it easier to work with.

13
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,003
You can install Power BI on your PC

14
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,009
by going to the Microsoft Store,

15
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,004
and searching for Power BI.

16
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,004
When you open Power BI Desktop,

17
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,004
you'll see the start screen.

18
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,007
I'll go ahead and close it.

19
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll open the report I've been working on.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,001
You can download this in the exercise files.

21
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,004
It's called customer sample report.

22
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,008
This report has a list of names and addresses

23
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,008
of my customers.

24
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,007
I also have a separate Excel spreadsheet

25
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,003
with their orders.

26
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,000
I want to combine these to create

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,008
a visual aid for the delivery team.

28
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:02,002
First, select Excel Workbook

29
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:05,004
from the home tab on the top ribbon.

30
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,008
Then browse for the sales order workbook,

31
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,009
which has two sheets.

32
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,005
You can download this in the exercise files,

33
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,007
it's called sales order.

34
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,009
Select both sheets then select load.

35
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,007
After both spreadsheets load,

36
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,008
you can see the tables in the field's panel

37
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,006
on the right.

38
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,007
Select model on the left menu,

39
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,002
and you'll see the relationship

40
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,008
Power BI found between the different tables

41
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,006
when it loaded both sheets.

42
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,001
A data model is the relationship

43
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,008
between the different data sources.

44
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:38,007
On the top ribbon,

45
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,006
select managed relationships.

46
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,004
Here I can see that sales order ID

47
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,009
is the common field

48
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,002
between the sales order detail table,

49
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:51,003
and the sales order header table.

50
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:54,005
Additionally, customer ID is the common field

51
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,004
between the sales order header table,

52
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,007
and the customer table.

53
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:02,004
Now all three of the tables are connected.

54
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,006
Let's explore the customer ID relationship

55
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,003
by selecting the second row,

56
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,002
and then edit at the bottom.

57
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:12,001
The cardinality field tells Power BI

58
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,001
which table has the primary record

59
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,007
for the customer ID column.

60
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,008
In our example,

61
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,003
the customer table is the primary record.

62
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:24,000
So each customer ID will appear once.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,002
A customer will likely place many orders,

64
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:27,009
and therefore Power BI

65
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:31,001
sets the cardinality to many to one.

66
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,001
You can modify this if necessary.

67
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:35,005
I'll select, okay.

68
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,004
Then close.

69
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:39,003
Pulling data from multiple spreadsheets

70
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,004
is a breeze in Power BI.

71
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,003
You can easily create relationships

72
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,006
between tables by finding the common fields

73
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,004
in those tables,

74
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:49,000
which means you can create reports

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,006
across multiple tables.

76
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,004
Take some time to build relationships

77
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:56,000
in Power BI with your existing spreadsheets.

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,001
You've got this.
