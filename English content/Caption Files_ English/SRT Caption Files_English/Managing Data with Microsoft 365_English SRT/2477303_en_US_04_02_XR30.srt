00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,004
- [Instructor] Before you can start

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:03,004
creating cool visualizations,

3
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:05,003
you'll need to know the common functions,

4
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:09,002
and the screens used to import and review data.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:10,002
In this lesson,

6
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:12,008
I'll show you how to navigate Power BI Desktop,

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:14,009
and connect the importance of reports

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,004
to the structure of the program.

9
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:20,002
You can install Power BI on your PC

10
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,007
by going to the Microsoft Store,

11
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:24,002
and searching for Power BI.

12
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:26,001
When you open Power BI Desktop,

13
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,002
you'll see the start screen.

14
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,005
Here you can see what's new,

15
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,000
the Power BI blog,

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
forums and various tutorials.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,001
On the left, it's a menu of options

18
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:40,004
where you can get data, access recent sources

19
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:42,009
or open other reports.

20
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,002
Once you close the window,

21
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,006
you'll be in the workspace.

22
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:47,007
At the top,

23
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,007
you'll see the home ribbon.

24
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,009
This ribbon contains the most common

25
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,002
Power BI functions.

26
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:56,008
New visual which adds a visualization

27
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,008
to your workspace.

28
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:02,006
Excel workbook to import data into the program.

29
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,009
And transform data to merge data.

30
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,000
On the left is a bar with three buttons

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,008
for the report, data and model screens.

32
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:14,008
Power BI starts on the report screen.

33
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:18,001
This is where you'll create visualizations.

34
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,008
I'll show you a report I'm working on

35
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,003
for my sales team.

36
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:24,002
You can download this in the exercise files.

37
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,004
It's called sales team visualization.

38
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,008
In my workspace,

39
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:31,006
there are three visualizations.

40
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,002
When I select the data tab,

41
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,009
I can see the data used to create this report.

42
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,009
This is the customer table.

43
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,000
It looks similar to an Excel table,

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,003
and on the right is a list of the other data sets

45
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,000
imported into Power BI.

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,009
Next I'll select the model tab.

47
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,000
This gives you a graphical representation

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,009
of your data and its relationships.

49
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,001
In this example,

50
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,002
you're looking at customers, their orders,

51
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,006
the order details,

52
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:03,003
and the products they purchased.

53
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,004
Now I'll switch back to the report screen.

54
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,007
On the right side of the reports workspace,

55
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,003
you'll see three panels,

56
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:14,003
filters, visualizations and fields.

57
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,009
You can use filters to modify your visualizations

58
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,008
to only show a subset of data.

59
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,007
Power BI allows users to easily

60
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,004
switch visualization type

61
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,005
by simply selecting the visual styles

62
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:28,002
from the visualization panel.

63
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,009
There are typical bar charts, pie charts,

64
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,005
as well as advanced charts.

65
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:35,009
The fields panel is where you select the data

66
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:38,001
you want to report on.

67
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,001
When you import data sources into Power BI,

68
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,009
they will show up in the field panel.

69
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:46,000
You will this panel to select fields

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,004
for your visualizations.

71
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:51,000
Finally, the report workspace is broken down

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,001
into different pages.

73
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,005
You can add more by selecting

74
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:56,007
the plus at the bottom.

75
00:02:56,007 --> 00:03:00,001
So that's a quick tour of Power BI.

76
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,007
Start small and import data

77
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:04,002
from an Excel workbook into the program,

78
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:06,001
and get comfortable with the tool.

79
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:06,009
Try it out.
