00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,000
- [Narrator] It's essential for you to be able to sort

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,003
and manage your data so that the most important information

3
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,004
is right at the top.

4
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:11,004
In this lesson, I'll show you how to use Excel

5
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,002
to sort and filter your data

6
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:16,006
so you can quickly find what you need.

7
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:19,003
In the top left corner of office.com,

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,008
I'll select the app launcher and open Excel.

9
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,003
From here, I'll open

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:27,003
the sample sales order Excel spreadsheet.

11
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:31,001
You can find this document in your exercise files.

12
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm interested in finding a specific order.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,002
To use the search function, I'll use find and select.

14
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,003
Then I'll select find

15
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,001
and enter the sales order number.

16
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,004
Now select find next and Excel will highlight that row.

17
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:48,009
You can also use these functions to look

18
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,005
for specific items ordered by good toys.

19
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:55,003
Here, I'll enter good toys and select find all

20
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:59,000
to see all the rows with the information I'm looking for.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,005
To find orders by customers more easily,

22
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,004
I'll sort the data by customer name.

23
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,002
First I'll select the column

24
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:09,009
then select sort and filter from the home ribbon.

25
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,008
Then I'll select sort ascending.

26
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:16,005
Let's say I want to see the sales from smallest to largest.

27
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:20,000
I will select the first cell in the total due column

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
then select sort and filter and sort ascending.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,006
Excel also allows you to filter data.

30
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,000
Filtering data allows you to see only the data

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,007
you're looking for.

32
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,006
For this example, I'll use the order detail sheet

33
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:36,005
by selecting its tab at the bottom.

34
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:39,007
Let's say I'm looking for orders from good toys.

35
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,007
I can navigate to the data ribbon

36
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:45,002
and add filter headings by selecting filter.

37
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,005
A dropdown is added to each header for the column.

38
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:51,000
Now I can select the values for the filters.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,001
First I'll select the company dropdown,

40
00:01:54,001 --> 00:02:02,002
deselect select all, then select good toys and apply.

41
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,002
These are the orders for good toys.

42
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:06,009
I can add more customers by selecting other customers

43
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,001
in the company dropdown.

44
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:11,005
I'll add action bicycle specialist

45
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,009
before selecting apply.

46
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,001
Once I'm done, I can remove all the filters

47
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,009
by selecting clear filter from company on the dropdown.

48
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:22,007
Excel also helped you sort using multiple columns

49
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,005
in a table.

50
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:26,002
I'm going to sort by the customer

51
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,006
and then by the line total.

52
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:32,005
I'll go to the data ribbon and select custom sort.

53
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:35,003
The custom dialogue allows me to pick the column to sort

54
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:37,008
and the order of appearance.

55
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:40,005
I'll start with the company column.

56
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:42,009
To add another column, I'll select add

57
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:46,006
and then I'll specify line total, sort descending,

58
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,008
and then select OK.

59
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:51,006
This produces a table where I can see the cost of the items

60
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:56,004
each customer ordered sorted from largest to smallest.

61
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:58,006
Now you have a few new ways to find

62
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:01,001
and sort data using Excel.

63
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,008
Take some time to sort and filter your data.

64
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:06,005
It all comes down to knowing what you're looking for.
