1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,009
- Whether your form has 5 question or 500 questions,

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,001
it should be organized well.

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,008
In this lesson I'll show you how to customize

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:13,003
and build clean dynamic surveys in Microsoft Forms.

5
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:16,003
In the top left corner of office.com,

6
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:20,004
I'll select the app launcher and open Forms.

7
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:24,009
Now I'll open the wedding planning consulting interest form.

8
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,005
First, I need to determine which fields are required

9
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,008
for a submission.

10
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,004
For this contact form,

11
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:33,006
the minimum information I'll need to be able

12
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,002
to follow up is an email address. .

13
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:39,003
Without it, I wouldn't know who to follow up with.

14
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:42,005
So I need to make email address a required question.

15
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:45,005
If I select the email address question

16
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:49,002
I can toggle the required button in the bottom right corner.

17
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:52,001
I'll repeat this for first name.

18
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,008
When the client views the form

19
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:57,006
the required questions will be indicated by a red asterisk.

20
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,005
Now that I've set the required fields

21
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,001
I can organize my survey into sections.

22
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,004
These help organize the survey

23
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,005
so the respondent sees questions in a logical flow.

24
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,004
I have three contact related questions

25
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:11,001
that would be good as a section, email address,

26
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,003
first name, and last name.

27
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,003
Select the last name question

28
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,008
and add new will appear below it.

29
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:22,000
Select add new, then more question types on the right

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,007
and select section.

31
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,006
This will add section two below last name

32
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,007
section one is at the top of the form

33
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,008
and contains the three contact information questions.

34
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,008
Now you can label each section

35
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:37,002
by selecting the header.

36
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,003
For the first section, I'll enter contact information

37
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:44,008
and leave the description box blank.

38
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,001
The next section revolves around timing.

39
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:51,003
I'll enter wedding date.

40
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:53,009
Now I'll add in a final section

41
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,002
by selecting the final question

42
00:01:56,002 --> 00:02:02,001
add new, more question types, and section.

43
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,004
This creates a section below this question

44
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:07,001
and I'll enter services.

45
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,001
I'll move the question

46
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,006
about how comfortable the client feels into this section.

47
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:15,003
Select the question and then the move question down arrow

48
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,005
in the top right corner.

49
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:20,003
Fantastic, I now have the wedding date questions

50
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:23,001
in the correct section and the form is organized.

51
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:24,008
You may also want to add branching

52
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:27,000
to your forms to further organize them.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,004
Branching changes which questions are asked based

54
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:33,000
on the respondent's answer to previous questions.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,001
For this form, if the client wants

56
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,002
to have a wedding in the next six months,

57
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,006
I want them to answer additional questions.

58
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:41,005
So I'll build a new section after services.

59
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,001
After the final question,

60
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:46,006
I'll select add new and then section.

61
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:51,004
I'll enter additional information as the name.

62
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,003
Then I'll add a new question,

63
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:57,002
select text, and turn on the long answer toggle

64
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,002
so clients can write a paragraph text.

65
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,008
This question will say

66
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:07,004
what bookings have you made for your wedding?

67
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:10,003
Then I'll go back to the rating question

68
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:13,008
and select copy question in the top right corner.

69
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:16,002
I'll select move question down once.

70
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:19,005
So the duplicate question is in section four.

71
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:23,004
Next to add branching, I'll go back to question four.

72
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:25,004
As the answer to this question will determine

73
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,003
what the next question will be.

74
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:31,003
To add branching select the more settings

75
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,000
for question then add branching.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If the client responds less than six months

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,003
I will branch the section four, additional information

78
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,002
by using the go-to dropdown

79
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:44,002
so I can gather the information I need.

80
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:47,001
For the other responses, I will leave them as go to next

81
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,005
and they will proceed to section three.

82
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:50,008
At the end of section three

83
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:53,005
I will change the go-to dropdown to end of form

84
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,007
so they do not have to fill out section four.

85
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:59,007
Select back to save your changes.

86
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:02,004
Now the form only asks for additional details

87
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:06,002
if their wedding is within the next six months.

88
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:08,002
Finally you want to test the survey.

89
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:10,003
Testing is essential to make sure your survey

90
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:14,005
looks and functions as you intended.

91
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,008
First I'll select preview in the upper right corner

92
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:23,007
I'll enter some test data, email, first name, last name.

93
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,007
When I select next,

94
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:27,000
the form goes to the wedding date section.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,009
I'll say my wedding is within the next six months.

96
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,001
And when I select next,

97
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:34,001
I am taken to the additional information section.

98
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,003
So the added branching worked correctly.

99
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,004
I'd say this is a successful form.

100
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:41,007
I'll select the submit button to complete the testing.

101
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:45,008
And select back to return to the edit questions page.

102
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:48,004
With sections and branching, you can create surveys

103
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:51,009
that take clients on a journey of your design.

104
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,007
I encourage you to try it yourself.

105
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:57,004
By using these tools, you can create engaging

106
00:04:57,004 --> 00:05:00,009
and useful surveys for both you and your customers.

107
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,007
Nice work.
