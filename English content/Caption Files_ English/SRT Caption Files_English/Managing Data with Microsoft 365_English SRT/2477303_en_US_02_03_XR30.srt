00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,009
- [Instructor] Missing a chat or message from a customer

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:06,004
can mean missing out on important communication.

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:09,007
With Power Automate, you can respond immediately,

4
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,008
even when you're away.

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,001
In this lesson,

6
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,009
I'll walk you through creating an automatic email reply

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:19,004
to a Microsoft form response, using Power Automate,

8
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,005
so that you can streamline your communication

9
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:24,002
and avoid missed messages.

10
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:26,007
In this example, I've created a contact form

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:29,008
for prospective clients that are interested in learning more

12
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,004
about ABC Wedding Planning Consulting.

13
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,006
I'd like to create an automated reply

14
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,008
to let the client know I've received their request

15
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:41,008
for information, as soon as they fill out the contact form.

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,008
I'm going to build a flow in Power Automate

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,003
to send this automatic reply.

18
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:49,000
In the top left corner of office.com,

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,008
I'll select the app launcher

20
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,003
and open Power Automate.

21
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:56,003
From here, I'll select Create on the left panel

22
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,006
to make a blank flow.

23
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:01,002
Next, I'll choose automated cloud flow,

24
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:03,009
the first option in the workspace.

25
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,000
You choose this option when you want your flow

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,006
to begin when an action happens.

27
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:09,005
I am using this,

28
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:13,006
because my flow will run each time my form is filled out.

29
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:16,007
This will open a dialogue where you can name the flow

30
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,008
and choose a trigger.

31
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to name this flow Auto Reply.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,007
Power Automate lists the common triggers.

33
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:28,007
I'll select when a new response is submitted,

34
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:30,009
then select Create.

35
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,008
Now, Power Automate takes me to the flow builder,

36
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,007
where I can specify that I want to use

37
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:39,005
the ABC Wedding Planning Consulting interest form.

38
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:40,006
The flow will be triggered

39
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,002
each time this form is filled out.

40
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,006
You may have to sign into Microsoft Forms

41
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,005
before being able to select your form.

42
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,007
My flow will need information from the form,

43
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:54,002
including the client's name and email address.

44
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:57,009
To get the data, I'll select new step.

45
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,007
I'll search for get response,

46
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:05,004
and add get response details to my flow.

47
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,002
For Form ID, I, again,

48
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:11,007
select ABC Wedding Planning Consulting interest form.

49
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,002
I will select Response ID,

50
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,007
and then select add dynamic content.

51
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,001
This will let me pull the response ID generated

52
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,000
when a new response is submitted.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,002
Now that I have the response details,

54
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:28,001
I can create the step to send the email.

55
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,009
I'll add a new step, and select Standard.

56
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll be using Office 365 Outlook,

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,001
because I want the emails

58
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,006
to come from my work email address.

59
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:41,009
If I used Mail, emails would be sent from my personal email.

60
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,005
I will use send an email V2,

61
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:48,003
and then start composing the automatic email response.

62
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:51,006
In the to field, I will select ad dynamic content,

63
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:55,001
and use the email address the client provided.

64
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:59,004
For subject, I'll enter Wedding Planning Interest.

65
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,001
In the body, I will add the submitter's first name

66
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:04,005
to make it feel more personal.

67
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:09,000
I will add dynamic content and select First Name.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,008
I'll enter my message.

69
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:14,003
Hello, First Name, thank you for contacting us.

70
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:18,004
We look forward to making your wedding day special.

71
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:24,006
One of our associates will be following up with you shortly.

72
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:26,008
After creating a flow, I'll select Save

73
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:29,006
in the upper right, and test my flow.

74
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:31,009
I always check my flow for errors first,

75
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,006
by selecting flow checker.

76
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,006
I have no errors or warnings,

77
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:39,000
and can test by selecting Test Flow,

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,002
and manually triggering it.

79
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:52,005
Isaiah has the form open, and will submit a response.

80
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,007
When the form is submitted,

81
00:03:53,007 --> 00:04:01,005
this flow I created will run automatically.

82
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:05,000
I now see that my flow has run successfully.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,007
The flow automatically sent a response to Isaiah.

84
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:11,003
Staying on top of communications is pivotal.

85
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,001
Consider where you can create a flow

86
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,009
that will immediately respond to your potential customers.

87
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,009
Power Automate allows you to quickly create processes

88
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,006
that boost your business's communication strategy.
