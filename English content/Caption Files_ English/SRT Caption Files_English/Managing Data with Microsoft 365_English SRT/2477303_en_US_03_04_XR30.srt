1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,009
- [Narrator] Data can come from many different places.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,008
You'll often have multiple spreadsheets that when combined,

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:08,000
would be more powerful.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,004
Being able to use Excel's XLOOKUP function

5
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:14,000
will save you time as you join data sources.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,001
It's easily my favorite function in Excel.

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,005
In this lesson, I'll show you

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:22,000
how to combine data sources using XLOOKUP.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,004
In order to use XLOOKUP, you'll need two Excel tables

10
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:28,003
with at least one column in common.

11
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,006
The XLOOKUP function has three required pieces,

12
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,007
The Lookup_value, the single cell I want to look up,

13
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,008
the Lookup_array, or the column where I'll find it,

14
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,006
and the Return_array,

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:43,004
the column with data I want to return as a result.

16
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:45,008
In the top left corner of Office.com,

17
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,002
I'll select the app launcher,

18
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:50,007
select all apps and open Excel.

19
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:54,004
For this example, I'll open the Customers and Orders file.

20
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:55,003
You can follow along

21
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:58,001
by downloading it from the exercise files.

22
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,006
This file has a sheet named Sales Order,

23
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:03,004
which has a list of all the orders that have been placed.

24
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,002
It lists all the Customer IDs, which have placed orders,

25
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:09,009
but it would be more helpful to have the customer names.

26
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,003
I have a second sheet in this workbook, Customer.

27
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:17,001
This has a column for both Customer ID and Customer Name.

28
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,003
I'll use XLOOKUP to bring the customer names

29
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:22,004
over into my Sales Orders table.

30
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:24,006
I'll return to Sales Order and add a new column,

31
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:28,001
Company Name, to the right of Customer ID.

32
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,007
This is where I'll populate the company names.

33
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,008
I'll select cell E1, then the dropdown under Insert

34
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:38,005
and then select Insert Table Columns to the left.

35
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,001
I'll rename column one to be Customer Name

36
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,009
by changing it in the Formula Bar.

37
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,004
Now that there's a new column, it's time to start.

38
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,003
I'll select cell E2,

39
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:54,005
and in the Formula Bar, I'll enter equals Xlookup.

40
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,008
When I start a cell using an equal sign,

41
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,008
it signifies that the cell is a function

42
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,003
and not simply a value.

43
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:04,005
The function parameters are listed below the Formula Bar

44
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,006
so I can readily know what to fill in.

45
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:10,000
The first parameter is Lookup_value.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,001
I want to find the Customer ID, so I'll select the cell, D2.

47
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,000
Excel recognizes it as the Customer ID column,

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,003
and populates that in my XLOOKUP formula.

49
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,003
Now I'll enter a comma into the Formula Bar

50
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:26,000
to move on to the next parameter.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,003
Next, I'll enter the column

52
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:31,002
where I want to find the Customer ID, the Lookup_array.

53
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,006
This is in the Customer sheet,

54
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:35,007
so while select its tab at the bottom.

55
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:39,006
Notice that XLOOKUP stays in the Formula Bar as I move.

56
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,007
I'll hover my cursor

57
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,004
near the bottom of the Customer ID column header

58
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:47,005
where it will change to an arrow and then select.

59
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,005
This will populate the Customer ID column

60
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,008
from the Customer's table

61
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:54,002
as a second parameter in the XLOOKUP.

62
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:56,004
It's where Excel will look for the Customer ID

63
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:59,004
it found in the Sales Order sheet.

64
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,006
Then, I'll enter a comma in the Formula Bar

65
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:05,004
to fill in the last required value, the Return_array.

66
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:07,002
When Excel finds the ID number

67
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,009
from my Sales Order table in the Customer table,

68
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:12,000
I want it to return the customer name

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,004
that is connected to it.

70
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:16,009
So I'll find the company name, column B,

71
00:03:16,009 --> 00:03:19,003
and we'll hover my cursor near the bottom of the header

72
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:23,001
until the down arrow appears and then select.

73
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:26,008
Now my XLOOKUP formula says take the Customer ID

74
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,007
from the Sales Order table,

75
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,002
look that up in the Customer sheet,

76
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,001
and return the Company Name.

77
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,003
I'll finish this XLOOKUP

78
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:39,002
by closing the formula with a right parenthesis.

79
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,008
Excel will take me back to the Sales Order table,

80
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:44,003
where the customer name has populated.

81
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,006
This is great. The XLOOKUP is complete.

82
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:52,004
Joining two tables is essential for analyzing data in Excel.

83
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,005
The next time you need to combine data

84
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,006
from two spreadsheets, try using XLOOKUP.

85
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,002
The more you practice using this function,

86
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,007
the easier it is to use.

87
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,002
You'll be amazed by what you can achieve.
