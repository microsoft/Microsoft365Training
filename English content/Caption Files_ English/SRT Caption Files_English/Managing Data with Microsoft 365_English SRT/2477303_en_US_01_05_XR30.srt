00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] Once I've created a survey,

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,004
I can't wait to send it to my clients

3
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,000
and collaborators, so they can fill it out.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,004
In this lesson, I'll show you the ways you can share

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:11,001
a survey created in Microsoft Forms.

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,004
In the top left corner of office.com,

7
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:17,005
I'll select the app launcher in open forms.

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,001
From here, I'll open the wedding planning

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,005
consulting interest form.

10
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:25,006
To share the survey, and gather data from your clients,

11
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,009
you'll select share in the upper right corner of the screen.

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,005
Let's look at send and collect responses.

13
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:34,000
There are four options for sharing a form,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,005
a link, QR code, embed, or email.

15
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,002
This dialogue defaults to the link option.

16
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,002
So, I'll show you that option first.

17
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,003
You can use a link in an email, a chat,

18
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,008
or even on social media.

19
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:49,008
Before sending a link,

20
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,003
I recommend checking the shortened URL box.

21
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:55,000
This will generate a short web address.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,004
Let's test the link before sending it to clients.

23
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:02,005
First, copy the shortened URL by selecting copy.

24
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:06,006
Then open a blank tab in your browser, then right click

25
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:09,004
in the address bar and select paste.

26
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,002
You're getting a look at how your client will view

27
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:13,004
this link in their web browser.

28
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,002
Let's keep exploring.

29
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:18,001
The next option is to generate a QR code.

30
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,005
When you select this option, Forms provide you

31
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:22,005
with a QR code image.

32
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,002
You'll download the QR code image,

33
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,007
and then, you can add it to any document.

34
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,005
The third option is to get a code to embed your survey

35
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,000
into your websites.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,006
You can use the HTML code Forms provides

37
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,004
in a website or email.

38
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:38,000
To get the code select copy.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,009
The final way you can share a survey is with an email.

40
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:42,001
When you select this option

41
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,001
your devices default email program

42
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:49,004
will open a new email draft with the form link in the body.

43
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,002
So, once your survey is out in the world,

44
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:53,009
I'm sure you'll be eager to see the results.

45
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,005
To see the results of my survey,

46
00:01:55,005 --> 00:02:00,001
I'll select the responses tab to view the data.

47
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,004
In the responses view, I can open an Excel

48
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,008
to view the data in Excel.

49
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,008
An Excel file will be downloaded that contains

50
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:08,003
the current results of your survey,

51
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,007
which is helpful for analyzing, sharing, and reporting.

52
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,004
Being able to share your hard work

53
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:15,007
and get the information you're looking for is easy

54
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,004
when using Microsoft Forms.

55
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,007
You now have a variety of options to send your survey

56
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,004
to current and potential clients.

57
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:23,002
Give it a try.
