00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] When you send an email,

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:04,000
you're starting a digital dialogue.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,006
So the person you're sending your email to

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,004
will need to know who you are and how they can respond.

5
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:12,006
Adding an email signature is an easy way

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:14,001
to sign off your emails

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,005
that you can use at the end of all your emails.

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,004
In this lesson, I'll show you

9
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,009
how to keep your sign-offs consistent

10
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:26,000
and your communication going strong with email signatures.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,001
For this example, I'm in the middle of a job search.

12
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,002
I may be sending multiple emails

13
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:33,003
as I apply for each new job.

14
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,000
Before I write my emails,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,007
I want to create an email signature

16
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:41,002
so I can have a standard ending to all my job search emails.

17
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,009
First, in the top-left corner of office.com,

18
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:50,007
select the app launcher and open Outlook.

19
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:56,000
From here, I'll go to Settings at the top right.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here you can change the look of your inbox,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,008
but I need to go to View all Outlook settings

22
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,008
to access more options.

23
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:08,003
Next I go to Compose and reply,

24
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:11,001
then the Email signature section.

25
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,002
This is where I create the signature that I want

26
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,007
for all my job search-related emails.

27
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:20,001
Here I'll add my name, my email address, and my phone number

28
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,005
in case someone needs to reach me right away.

29
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:25,002
Then I'll give my email signature a name.

30
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,004
I'll call it Job search so I can reuse it later.

31
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,009
There are a lot of options in Compose and reply.

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,005
I can select a default signature,

33
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:38,007
alter how I format messages,

34
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,009
and a lot more.

35
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,004
For simply setting up an email signature,

36
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:44,004
you don't need to worry

37
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:48,003
about diving too deep below this first section.

38
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:51,006
I'll save my email signature

39
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:55,004
and close out of here by selecting the X.

40
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:58,002
Now that I have my email signature set up and saved,

41
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,007
it's ready to use.

42
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:02,004
So I'll select New message.

43
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:05,005
At the bottom of the window with my new email,

44
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,006
I'll select more options,

45
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:11,001
then select Insert signature,

46
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:14,001
and select the Job search signature,

47
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,006
and the signature will be added to the new email.

48
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:20,000
Now you know how to create a signature

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,005
to add to any email you compose,

50
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:25,008
saving time when you want to share the same information

51
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:27,004
at the end of your emails.
