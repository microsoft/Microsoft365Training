00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,002
- [Joni] Have you ever witnessed a presentation

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,006
that was so text-heavy,

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,004
you didn't know where to focus your attention?

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,001
Not a fun experience.

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,007
Formatting texts into different fonts and colors

6
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:12,007
can help your audience clearly understand

7
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:14,007
your presentation's message.

8
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:18,000
In this lesson, I'll show you how you can use PowerPoint

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,004
to change the appearance of your presentation's text

10
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,006
so that your audience can keep their focus

11
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,000
on the most important information.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,008
In this example,

13
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,002
I open PowerPoint to add to the presentation

14
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:32,001
I'm creating for an upcoming job interview.

15
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,005
You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation

16
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,005
from the Exercise Files.

17
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,007
Now that I have my presentation open,

18
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,009
I want to change the font color,

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:46,009
so I'll select change font color from the menu,

20
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:50,007
then choose the color I want

21
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:55,000
and watch my highlighted text change to that color.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,003
Next, I want to italicize the text.

23
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,004
With the text highlighted,

24
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:05,001
I'll select italics from the menu.

25
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,000
Looks great.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,003
Now you can alter the look of any text you add

27
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,005
to a PowerPoint to help your presentation stand out.
