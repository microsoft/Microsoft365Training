- [Joni] When you need to present

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,004
important ideas visually, PowerPoint is the tool

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,004
that takes your communication to another level.

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,005
In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through

5
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:12,002
how to create a presentation in PowerPoint and add

6
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,000
your first slide.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,001
First I'll open PowerPoint.

8
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,000
And in this example, I've been selected

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,001
for a remote job interview and was asked to

10
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,005
create a PowerPoint presentation to showcase my skills.

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:28,007
So next, I'll select New blank presentation.

12
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:31,000
Before going too far I want to make sure

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I've renamed and saved my presentation.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can see the save status next to the title

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,004
of the presentation, and it is saved.

16
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:43,000
If I select the title, a new window opens,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,003
and I can rename the presentation Interview slides.

18
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:49,003
After I renamed the presentation,

19
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:53,008
I can select anywhere outside the window and it will close.

20
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:57,005
I want to focus on adding content at the moment.

21
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,002
And so I'm going to close Designer.

22
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:03,003
The first slide is a title slide.

23
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:07,004
So I'll write the title, Skills overview.

24
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,009
Then I'll add my name under the title

25
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,001
so my audience will remember me.

26
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:17,000
I now have the first slide in my presentation and I'm ready

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,007
to add more slides.

28
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:22,000
Now, you know how to create a PowerPoint presentation.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,004
Go ahead and try to add a slide to your own presentation.
