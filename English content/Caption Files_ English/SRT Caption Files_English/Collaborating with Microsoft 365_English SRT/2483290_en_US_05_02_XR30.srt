- [Instructor] Keeping a consistent composition

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,007
throughout a PowerPoint presentation

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:06,004
allows your audience to focus

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,006
on the important ideas you're presenting

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,002
without getting distracted.

6
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,008
In this lesson I'm going to show you

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,009
how Designer can help you

8
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,002
create a consistent look throughout your presentation

9
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,003
keeping your audience's attention

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,006
on your PowerPoint's content,

11
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:23,003
not its composition.

12
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,004
So first I'll open my presentation in PowerPoint.

13
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:27,007
You can follow along by downloading

14
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,008
the sample presentation

15
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,002
from the exercise files.

16
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,000
In this example,

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,008
I've already created a presentation

18
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:35,001
that I've been asked to prepare

19
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,000
for an upcoming interview.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,001
Now, I want to change the look

21
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,002
of the presentation by using Designer

22
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,005
to get started.

23
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,002
Now that I'm in my presentation,

24
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,004
I'll select Designer.

25
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,008
Wow.

26
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,009
Look at all of these different looks.

27
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,007
I'll find a design I like

28
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,005
and choose it.

29
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,001
Now that I've chosen a design,

30
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,009
I can add a new slide.

31
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,004
I'll select the dropdown

32
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:02,002
beside the New Slide icon,

33
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,006
then I can choose the layout

34
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,007
of the slide I want to add.

35
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,005
I'll add a Two Content slide,

36
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:09,000
giving me a layout with space

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
for the title and two types of information.

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm going to add a new title

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,003
and name this slide, Software skills,

40
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:22,007
then add text in one of the content sections.

41
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,003
By using Designer,

42
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:27,007
my entire presentation will have a consistent look

43
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,001
that will keep my audience's attention

44
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,005
on my skills.

45
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,009
I encourage you to explore design ideas

46
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,001
and choose a look for your presentations

47
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,008
that will wow your audience.
