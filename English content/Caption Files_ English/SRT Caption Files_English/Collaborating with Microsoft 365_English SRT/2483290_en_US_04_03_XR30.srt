- [Joni] Scrolling through an endless inbox

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,004
for that one email you need can feel like

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,009
trying to find a needle in a haystack,

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:11,000
but Outlook has a search tool that makes it easy

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,002
to find any email.

6
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:17,001
In this lesson I'm going to show you how to search

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,004
your email inbox.

8
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,009
I'll start in my Outlook inbox.

9
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,005
In this example, I have an interview for a job,

10
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:27,000
and the company has asked me to create a PowerPoint

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,007
presentation for my interview.

12
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:32,000
The company sent me an email with the presentation

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,004
instructions but I can't remember all of the requirements.

14
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:39,005
To be able to know exactly what's expected of me,

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,006
I'll need to search for this email in Outlook.

16
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:46,004
I remember the email had the word presentation in it.

17
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,005
So I'll go to the search box and type in

18
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:54,007
the word presentation then select Enter.

19
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,004
This searches my email for all the emails

20
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,005
with the word presentation.

21
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:03,002
Here's the email I was looking for.

22
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:06,008
I'll open it to see the requirements.

23
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:11,005
As you can see Outlook has also highlighted the search word.

24
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,002
If you wanted to narrow your search to only find emails

25
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,008
that have attachments, you could use Filter.

26
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:21,000
First, I'll navigate back to my Inbox.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll select the Filter button above my mailbox,

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,007
select Attachments, and now my mailbox is only showing

29
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,002
emails that have attachments

30
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:35,006
Now that you know how to search your email,

31
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:38,006
you'll be able to quickly find any email

32
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,007
even if it's buried deep in your inbox.
