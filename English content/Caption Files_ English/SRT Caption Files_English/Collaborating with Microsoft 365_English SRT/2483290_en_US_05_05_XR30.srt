- [Instructor] When words aren't enough to communicate

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:07,001
an idea, PowerPoint provides a simple visual solution.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,000
With PowerPoint presentations,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,008
you can add pictures and icons to your slides

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,008
that help illustrate important information.

6
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:15,007
In this lesson,

7
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:20,001
I'll show you how to add pictures to your presentations.

8
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,008
In this example, I open PowerPoint to add

9
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:24,003
to the presentation I'm creating

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,007
for an upcoming job interview.

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:29,007
You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation

12
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:32,001
from the exercise files.

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,006
Now that I have my presentation open,

14
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:38,002
I want to add pictures and icons to some of the slides.

15
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:41,008
I'll start with the About Me slide.

16
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,003
For this slide I chose two content as my layout,

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,004
so it's ready for a picture to be added.

18
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:52,001
I have several types of content I can add.

19
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:57,004
A table, smart art, icons, pictures from my computer,

20
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,007
stock images, or even a video from the web.

21
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,005
I'll show you how to view stock images

22
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:07,006
so you can see what visuals PowerPoint has to offer.

23
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:10,002
You can type a term in the search bar

24
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:13,002
or select from the categories below.

25
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:17,005
I'll type cooperation because I like helping other people.

26
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:22,008
I find an image that I like, select it to add it

27
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,008
to my presentation.

28
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:28,002
Then I select Insert.

29
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:32,009
And just like that, the picture is on the About Me slide.

30
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,006
Now I want to change the look of my image,

31
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:37,004
including its size and location.

32
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,007
With the image selected,

33
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:43,002
I can alter its shape and placement.

34
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,009
There's a button that rotates the image using

35
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:50,001
the rotation feature, and I can also drag and drop the image

36
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,009
to a new location.

37
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:54,001
To alter the size of your image,

38
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,007
use the corners to keep the proportions the same.

39
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:00,007
If you use the sizing options to only make it taller,

40
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:04,004
or only wider, the proportions of the image will distort.

41
00:02:04,004 --> 00:02:06,003
I'll move on to the next slide.

42
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,003
I think the software skill slide could benefit

43
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,005
from the addition of an icon.

44
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,004
I'll select icon.

45
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:16,008
I'll search for a computer icon.

46
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:23,008
Find one that I like, select it, select insert

47
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:26,001
and it's added to my slide.

48
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,002
I can also change the color

49
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:31,008
of the icon by right clicking the icon.

50
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:34,003
I want to change the fill

51
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:37,006
or the color of the inner space of the icon.

52
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:41,004
Once I select the dropdown menu from Graphics, Fill,

53
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:48,001
I can choose the color I want from these options.

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,002
I'll make my icon larger so it's easier to see.

55
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:55,000
Before I finish, I'm going to take another look

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,008
at the design options to see

57
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:59,009
if there's a better look for my slides.

58
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:08,007
I'll select the design options I like most for each slide.

59
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:11,004
Now my presentation looks really great

60
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:14,001
with the added picture and icon.

61
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,001
Try out your new skills by adding some visual content

62
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:20,004
to your presentation to really engage your audience.
