00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] Things change quickly,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:06,002
and you need spreadsheets that adapt just as fast.

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,008
With a few key features in Excel,

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,008
you can edit and manage your data easily.

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:15,001
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to use Excel

6
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,008
to keep track of new information

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,005
and remove old information

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:22,004
so that you can keep your data up to date and useful.

9
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:24,005
I'll start by opening the sample budget

10
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:27,004
that you can find in the exercise files.

11
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,003
So now that I can see my budget,

12
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,002
I want to see how it's changed

13
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:33,007
between this month and last month.

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,000
To see this in my table,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,009
I need to add columns.

16
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,005
To add a column between the A and B columns,

17
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,008
I select the B column and right-click.

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,002
A menu with several options open.

19
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:49,003
I want to select Insert Columns.

20
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,003
A column is added between A and B.

21
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,007
The data in the columns is still the same,

22
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,008
but everything has shifted to the right.

23
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,007
Next, I'll name the new column to keep my data organized.

24
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:05,009
I'll title the new column Last Month.

25
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:11,006
And I'll name my amount column This Month.

26
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:18,002
I can now add data from the previous month to my table.

27
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:21,008
If, instead, you want to remove an entire column,

28
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:24,000
select the column you want removed,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,005
right-click,

30
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:30,000
and select Delete Columns.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,007
The entire column is removed.

32
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:36,002
Adding and removing rows uses similar steps.

33
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:40,004
Say you want to add a row between row six and row seven.

34
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:43,002
First, select row seven,

35
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,006
right-click,

36
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:49,003
then select Insert Rows.

37
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,007
A new row has been added,

38
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:54,004
which I can use to add a new expense.

39
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,009
To delete a row,

40
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:00,003
first select the row you want removed,

41
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,000
right-click,

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,008
and select Delete Rows.

43
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,009
The entire row is removed.

44
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,003
Suppose you want to add a title to your expenses table.

45
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:16,006
First, add a row above your table for the title.

46
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:20,008
This new row has sales for each column in my table.

47
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,009
For my title, I only need one cell,

48
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,006
so I can use the merge feature

49
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:28,004
to combine these different cells into a single cell.

50
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,008
Merge will only keep the data in the upper left cell,

51
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:33,006
so I need to place my title

52
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,008
in the cell farthest to the left.

53
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:41,003
Here, I'll type My Monthly Expenses Table.

54
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:46,005
Next, select all the cells you want to merge.

55
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:50,000
Go to the Alignment section in your ribbon,

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,008
select Merge & Center.

57
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:57,001
Merge & Center will merge the two cells into one cell

58
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,004
and center the text.

59
00:02:58,004 --> 00:03:03,001
I can also select Unmerge Cells here.

60
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,003
Now that you know how to add, delete,

61
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:08,003
merge and unmerge columns and rows,

62
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:10,008
you have the flexibility you need

63
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:13,004
to manage your ever-changing data.
