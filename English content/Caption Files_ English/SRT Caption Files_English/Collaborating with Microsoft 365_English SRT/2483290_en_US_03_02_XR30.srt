00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] If you're starting from scratch

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,000
every time you create a document,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you might feel like you're reinventing the wheel.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,001
But with OneNote,

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:13,000
you can easily create consistent documents using templates,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,005
tailoring your notebook to your needs in no time.

7
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:19,002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create pages

8
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,006
to store information in your notebook

9
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,006
and also how to use templates to save you time.

10
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:26,004
In OneNote, you can create notebooks,

11
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,004
which are made up of sections.

12
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,008
Each section contains pages

13
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:34,000
and that's where you'll document your notes.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
First, I'll open my notebook.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,008
So to create a new page,

16
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,004
I'll select Add page at the bottom of my notebook.

17
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,001
We can start here.

18
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,007
Now, I will add the information

19
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to keep track of for each job,

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,003
like the job title, company name, how to apply, and more.

21
00:00:54,003 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll select where I want to add content and add the content.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can also format any text you add

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,007
to make it stand out.

24
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:10,005
Here, I'll make the application due date larger,

25
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,004
in bold,

26
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:16,006
and in a different color to really make it stand out.

27
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:19,008
I also want to add a table at the bottom of this page

28
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:24,002
to compare the pros and cons of this job.

29
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,005
First, I select where I want my table to go.

30
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,008
I select Insert,

31
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,008
select Table,

32
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:35,003
and highlight the size that I need for my table.

33
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll choose two rows and two columns.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,007
The table is inserted,

35
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:44,002
and I'll label the columns Pros and Cons.

36
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:56,009
I'll also add bullets by selecting bullets.

37
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,008
So the information I enter

38
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:02,000
will be neatly organized at my table.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,008
Now that I have a design for my notes,

40
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:09,005
I'll name this page Job search template.

41
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:13,005
The title goes to the top of each page.

42
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:17,001
Next, I will replicate this Job search template page

43
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,007
for each job I am interested in

44
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,009
by right-clicking on the page,

45
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,002
selecting Move/Copy from the menu that appears,

46
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:27,001
and then choosing Copy.

47
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,004
I now have a duplicate

48
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,005
of my Job search template page.

49
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,008
From here, I'll rename this page

50
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:36,009
based on a job I'm interested in.

51
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:39,004
Now, I'll enter the information

52
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:42,005
that I have for this job search, like the job title,

53
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:45,009
the company name, and how to apply.

54
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,002
I can come back and fill in the other details

55
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,005
when I have them.

56
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:52,007
Now, you have the skills to create custom templates

57
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,009
and pages in your own notebooks.

58
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,008
Try it out.
