1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:03,004
- Managing multiple sheets could be a mess,

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:05,000
but with Excel Worksheets

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,001
you can keep your work organized and easy to access,

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:12,001
by adding multiple sheets into a single Workbook.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,001
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

6
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,008
how to manage your worksheets more efficiently,

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:21,004
so you can keep your digital workspace free of clutter.

8
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:24,009
I've created a chart so you can see a visual representation

9
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,008
of what monthly expenses might look like.

10
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:30,003
Right now I have a pie chart of my expenses

11
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:34,004
and one of the sheets within my workbook titled, My Budget.

12
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:37,005
The sheet it's in right now is labeled Expenses.

13
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:41,001
And the chart is sitting next to the table of expenses.

14
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,002
But I want it in its own sheet.

15
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,005
In order to do that I will add a new sheet

16
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,004
by selecting the new sheet button

17
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:50,000
at the bottom of the workbook.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,003
A new blank sheet will pop up

19
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,007
and you'll be able to give it a name.

20
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,009
I'll name this sheet Pie Chart.

21
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:01,001
In order to move the pie chart over to this new sheet,

22
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:05,005
I'll select the chart from the old sheet and cut it.

23
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:07,008
Then I'll go to the new pie chart sheet

24
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,005
and choose where I want to place my chart.

25
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,003
I want to place the chart in B2.

26
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:17,001
So I'm going to select that cell then paste the pie chart.

27
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:21,002
I can now see my chart in the pie chart worksheet.

28
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,006
In the table of expenses still exist

29
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,005
in the expenses worksheet.

30
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:29,001
If I wanted to continue growing this workbook

31
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,001
I could easily add another new worksheet

32
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:34,005
and use that for a guest list, to do's,

33
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:38,009
or any other aspect that fits within my overall budget.

34
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,000
To keep multiple worksheets organized in the same workbook

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,007
I can change the order of my sheets

36
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:47,005
by dragging and dropping the tabs.

37
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,004
Now that you know how to build out a workbook

38
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,001
to include individual worksheets,

39
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:56,007
gathering, organizing and referencing all that data

40
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,002
will be much easier.

41
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,008
Whether you're creating a new budget

42
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:02,003
or need to keep track of job searches.

43
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,008
I encourage you to make the most of your workbooks

44
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,007
by creating individual worksheets

45
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:08,008
for each element of your project.
