00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,003
- [Instructor] Have you ever finished

2
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:04,000
describing the steps of a complex task

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,009
only to realize it would've been simpler

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,005
to arrange the steps in another order?

5
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:09,006
In this lesson,

6
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,003
I'll show you how to apply slide layouts

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,000
and change the slide order

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,007
so your PowerPoint presents and flows perfectly.

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,005
In this example, I open PowerPoint

10
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,007
to start adding to the presentation I'm creating

11
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,008
for an upcoming job interview.

12
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,008
You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation

13
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,003
from the exercise files.

14
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:32,006
I already have two slides created,

15
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,002
and I want to add a new slide

16
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:37,002
that shares some information about myself.

17
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,009
I'll choose a title and content slide

18
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,001
to show this information.

19
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,008
I'll title it About Me.

20
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,008
Then, I'll add a few highlights to introduce myself

21
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,003
and my background.

22
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:54,003
I love helping people.

23
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:58,004
I've recently completed a customer service training.

24
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,001
Now that I see the slide,

25
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,001
I think I'd like to change the layout

26
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,002
to leave room to add a picture later.

27
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:09,002
I can select Layout to see my options.

28
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:13,008
I'll change the current layout to Two Content.

29
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:18,005
Hmm, this slide order doesn't seem right.

30
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:20,006
I think I want the About Me slide

31
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:23,002
to go in front of my skills slide

32
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:27,000
so my audience gets to know me before my skills.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,009
To change the slide order,

34
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,006
I'll select View

35
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,006
and make sure I'm in the Normal view setting.

36
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,009
In the Normal view setting,

37
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,001
I can see the image of my slides

38
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,002
on the slide and the navigation pane.

39
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,004
I can go to the navigation pane

40
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,003
and select the About Me slide,

41
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:50,005
then drag and drop it above my skills slide.

42
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:54,001
My slides are now in an order that makes sense.

43
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,005
So that's it.

44
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:59,006
Now, you can change the slide layout and the slide order.

45
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:03,007
Use this skill to reframe how you share information

46
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:06,004
in any of your PowerPoint presentations.
