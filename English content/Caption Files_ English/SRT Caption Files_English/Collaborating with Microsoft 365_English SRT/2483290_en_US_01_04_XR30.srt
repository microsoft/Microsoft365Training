00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,006
- [Instructor] There's a great feeling of accomplishment

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:05,003
when you finish a project and are ready to share it

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:06,009
with the world.

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,003
To make sure you're sharing the best version

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:12,005
of your work to whoever needs to see it,

6
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:16,000
you need to turn that document into a PDF

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,008
and Microsoft Word makes it incredibly easy to do that.

8
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,003
So what exactly is a PDF?

9
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:25,008
Think of it as a digital version of printed paper.

10
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:26,007
In this lesson,

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:30,005
I'll show you how to print your documents digitally,

12
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,007
making them into PDFs so that you can share them

13
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:37,001
with the world exactly as you intended them to look.

14
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,006
To begin, download the exercise file

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:45,001
and open up the Sample Resume Word document.

16
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:49,005
My resume looks how I want, so I'm ready to finalize it.

17
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:54,005
I'll go to the ribbon at the top of Word and select file.

18
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,001
A new window pops up with several options.

19
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:59,003
I can create a new file,

20
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:04,007
Open an existing File, Save, Share, Export or Print.

21
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:08,009
To make a PDF, I'll select Save As.

22
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:13,001
Once I select Save As, a few options open in a new window.

23
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,002
I want to make my resume a PDF.

24
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:18,007
So I'll select Download as PDF.

25
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,008
After I select Download as PDF,

26
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:23,001
I need to choose where I want to save my document

27
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,006
and what I want to name it.

28
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:25,008
To easily find it later,

29
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,007
I want to save it in the same folder where

30
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,009
I've stored my Resume Word document.

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,009
So I've already navigated to the folder and my OneDrive

32
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,002
where my resume is located.

33
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:41,003
I'll simply drag and drop the resume into my OneDrive.

34
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:43,002
When you're sharing files with others,

35
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,001
you'll definitely want to name the file

36
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,007
in a way that communicates what's

37
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,007
in the document before it's open.

38
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:54,003
I'll name this document J Sherman Resume

39
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:59,003
Administrative Assistant and select Rename.

40
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,002
So that's it.

41
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,000
I have my resume saved as a PDF,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,008
and now you know how to create a version

43
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,007
of your documents that preserves your content

44
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:11,001
and format perfectly every time.

45
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,007
Saving your documents as PDFs is a great way

46
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,007
to make sure the document keeps all

47
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:17,006
of your intended formatting.

48
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:20,007
Even if different people access it from different devices

49
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,005
using a variety of software.
