1
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,007
- If you asked me to teach you to do

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:05,008
one single thing in Excel

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:09,009
I would want to show you how to create and format tables.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,004
It's such an important skill.

5
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:16,004
Once you're comfortable with inputting data into a table

6
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,004
you'll be ready to start using all the powerful tools

7
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,005
and functions in Excel.

8
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:24,002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to get started

9
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:27,004
with tables so that you can begin using Excel's

10
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:30,004
excellent calculating capabilities.

11
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,002
The first thing to do is open Excel

12
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,002
from the app launcher on Office.com.

13
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,005
Next I'll need to create a workbook.

14
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:41,001
A workbook is a file that contains one or more worksheets

15
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,008
to help organize data.

16
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:46,002
Think of it as the digital version of a physical workbook,

17
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:50,000
a single place to keep several related sheets together.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,001
In Excel, there are a few different ways

19
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,003
to start a new workbook.

20
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:58,007
I can choose from templates or create a blank workbook.

21
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:01,000
In this lesson I'm going to create a new budget

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,002
as an example.

23
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:07,007
So I'll start from scratch and select new blank workbook.

24
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:10,001
Once the workbook is created,

25
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:14,003
I'm going to name and then save the new workbook right away,

26
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:17,003
so I won't lose any of my work.

27
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,008
Select the file name to open a window

28
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,009
where you can change the name

29
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:25,005
and the location of where it'll be saved.

30
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:28,008
I'm going to name this My Budget.

31
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:31,006
Now that I've named and saved my workbook

32
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:34,000
I want to take a look at my worksheet.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,001
Creating a workbook automatically creates sheet one,

34
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,007
a blank spreadsheet that's ready to go.

35
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,005
You can create additional sheets

36
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,003
by selecting the plus sign at the bottom,

37
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:48,002
but for now I only need one sheet.

38
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:52,001
To rename a sheet, hover over the tab at the bottom left

39
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:56,007
of the screen and right click sheet one.

40
00:01:56,007 --> 00:02:00,002
A menu will open with a number of actions to choose from.

41
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,008
Select rename, now a new window opens

42
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:06,002
asking to rename the sheet.

43
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:09,009
I'm going to rename the sheet Expenses.

44
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,008
Then select Okay.

45
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,007
Notice the tab that was labeled sheet one

46
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,001
is now labeled Expenses.

47
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,005
Now that I've renamed my sheet, I'm ready to create a table.

48
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:23,007
First I'll label the column so that I know where to put

49
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,008
each piece of information.

50
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:26,008
In this sample,

51
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:29,008
I want to track my monthly expenses.

52
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,009
So I'll label two columns,

53
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:35,001
one column for types of monthly expenses

54
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,002
and another for their amounts.

55
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:41,004
To label the first column, select the A1 cell

56
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:44,007
and type monthly expenses.

57
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,004
For the second column,

58
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:50,009
select the B1 cell and name it amount.

59
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,003
I want to be able to see the full title

60
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:56,001
for my monthly expenses.

61
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:58,000
So I'll just adjust the column width,

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,003
to see all of my text.

63
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:03,000
Now that I have headers for the information

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,001
I'm going to put into my table,

65
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:07,006
I can start adding data to my table.

66
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:11,002
I have a number of expenses to categorize and keep track of.

67
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:15,006
So I'll type these categories under monthly expenses.

68
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,008
I'll start with housing.

69
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:21,007
Next, I'll enter the amount I spend for housing each month

70
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,003
in my second column.

71
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,009
I select cell B2 and type in the amount.

72
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,006
Now that I've added housing to my table,

73
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:34,004
I'll do the same thing for the rest of my monthly expenses.

74
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,003
Now that I've input my data

75
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:40,008
I can make the table easier to read using format as table.

76
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:44,007
I'll select all the cells of my table, including the titles.

77
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:47,000
Then in the styles portion of the ribbon

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,002
select format as table.

79
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:51,004
This opens several formatting options

80
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:53,001
for tables I could use.

81
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:55,002
I'll choose the alternating colors format

82
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:59,004
because it makes it easier for me to read each line.

83
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:02,007
Since my table has titles, or headers, at the top

84
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,001
I'm going to make sure to leave

85
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,001
my table has headers selected.

86
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,005
I now have a budget that is formatted the way that I want

87
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,001
and is ready to use.

88
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,000
Now that you know how to create and format a table

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,006
you can give it a try with your own data.
