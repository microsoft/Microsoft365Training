00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:03,003
- [Instructor] A paper notebook is bound by its cover,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,000
but a digital notebook goes far beyond that,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,002
building bridges to the rest of the internet.

4
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,003
With OneNote, you can use your notebook

5
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:14,002
as a portal to the worldwide web.

6
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,001
In this lesson, I'll show you

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:19,003
how to easily connect your notebook to any website

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,003
by adding links.

9
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,000
This can be really useful

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,004
when adding key information like a company's website

11
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,005
in your job search.

12
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:33,000
First, I'll open My job search notes notebook.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,007
So here I am in the notebook

14
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,003
where I'm keeping notes about my job search.

15
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,008
I have created a template I can use

16
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:43,000
to keep track of each job I'm interested in.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,005
I'm curious about jobs I might find at Microsoft.

18
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,008
So I'll use the template to create a page

19
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:52,004
for my job search at Microsoft.

20
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:57,007
I'll rename my page Microsoft search.

21
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,009
I'm not ready to search or make notes yet,

22
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,007
but I know there is a career site at Microsoft,

23
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,004
so I want to link my notes

24
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,008
directly to that useful information.

25
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:11,004
I can do this by adding a link to the page.

26
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:15,003
If I already know the web address, I can add it directly.

27
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:20,009
First I want to select where the link will go on my page.

28
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll select Insert and Insert Link,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,003
I'll type in the text I want to display for the link,

30
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:33,005
and then type in the web address,

31
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,000
and now I'll select Insert.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,003
I can also go directly to the website in my browser

33
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,008
and select the web address,

34
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:45,000
then copy and paste it on my page in OneNote.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,005
Now you can add links to pages in your notebooks

36
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,007
to make more dynamic connections

37
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:53,002
than you could with a paper notebook alone.
