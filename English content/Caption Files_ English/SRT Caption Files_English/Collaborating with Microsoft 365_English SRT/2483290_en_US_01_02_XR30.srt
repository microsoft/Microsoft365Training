00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Narrator] When you're searching for a job,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,008
you're likely spending valuable time

3
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:07,003
thinking about your resume, or CV.

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,002
You might even want to take it to the next level

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,006
and give your resume a brand new professional look.

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:16,001
With Styles, there's a quick and easy way to do just that.

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,004
Adjust the font, look and color

8
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:21,000
of the different parts of your documents.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,005
I'm going to show you

10
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,000
how to make your documents look their best

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,008
and stand out from the rest.

12
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,003
To get started, download the sample resume

13
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:30,005
available in the Exercise Files,

14
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,008
and I'll walk you through how to customize your resume.

15
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:36,003
Here, you can see I have the file open in Word.

16
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,006
I use the template to create the resume,

17
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,005
but I want to make some slight adjustments

18
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,009
so it looks just right.

19
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,007
To quickly see what different styles are available,

20
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:49,005
I'll go to the Style tab on the ribbon.

21
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,002
So many great options.

22
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:54,009
I want to start by changing the style

23
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:58,001
for my school in the Education section.

24
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,004
So I'll just highlight that portion of text.

25
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,000
Head back to the ribbon.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,005
Select the Style tab. There are several options in styles.

27
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:12,007
Notice the differences in font color, size

28
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:16,006
and other text formats, like Emphasis or Bold?

29
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:20,009
Since I'm adjusting my school to add focus to it,

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,001
I'll choose Heading 3.

31
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,002
As you can see,

32
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:27,008
Word changes the highlighted text to match the style.

33
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:30,004
Now, there are a lot of options to choose from

34
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,007
in the Styles dropdown,

35
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:36,005
but you might not find the perfect fit you're looking for.

36
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,008
If you still aren't finding the perfect fit,

37
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,003
you can try to create your own style.

38
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:44,003
I'll change the style for the name.

39
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,002
With my name already highlighted,

40
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:50,005
I'll change the font color and make it blue.

41
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,007
And then I'll also put it in Italics.

42
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:57,001
With that perfect font, color and style picked out,

43
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,008
just head back to Styles

44
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:05,006
and then choose Create New Style from Formatting.

45
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:13,001
Give that style a name, and I'll call it Blue Italics

46
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,000
and click OK.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,004
And now, my new original style

48
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,008
will be ready to use elsewhere.

49
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,006
And that's all there is to it.

50
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:23,002
Styles can help quickly change

51
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:25,007
multiple formatting options all at once,

52
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:28,009
standardizing them across your entire document.

53
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:31,000
Practice your skills by changing the style

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
of some text in your documents to elevate their look.
