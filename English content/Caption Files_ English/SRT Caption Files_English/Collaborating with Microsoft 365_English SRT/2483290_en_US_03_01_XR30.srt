- [Instructor] Accessing, organizing, and using notes

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:07,000
in a paper notebook can be really challenging.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,009
OneNote is a digital notebook

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,005
that makes your information work for you.

5
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,007
In this lesson,

6
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:16,003
I'm going to walk you through creating a notebook in OneNote

7
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:20,000
so that you can keep your information organized, useful,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,003
and accessible from anywhere, anytime.

9
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,001
For job seekers, it's necessary

10
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,002
to keep track of detailed information

11
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,002
on each job you search for.

12
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:30,000
In this example,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,008
I'll show you how to create a notebook in OneNote

14
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:35,006
to help with that important task.

15
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,008
First, in the top left corner of office.com,

16
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:42,004
select the app launcher and open OneNote.

17
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,007
Now that I've opened OneNote,

18
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:45,009
it's time to create a new notebook.

19
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,007
Select the Add new notebook option

20
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,006
and give the new notebook a name.

21
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:56,007
I'll name my notebook My job search notes,

22
00:00:56,007 --> 00:01:02,006
and then I'll select Create.

23
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,002
After the notebook is created,

24
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:08,001
it's time to organize content by adding sections.

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,001
When you open a brand-new notebook,

26
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,006
you'll see this alert that the notebook is empty

27
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:14,003
with no sections.

28
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:17,003
In OneNote, every notebook is made up of sections

29
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:20,001
and each section has pages.

30
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,002
Think of these sections like dividers

31
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:25,004
between loose-leaf papers and a physical binder.

32
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:29,004
To add a section, I'm going to select Add section.

33
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,006
A window opens, asking for a section name.

34
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,002
Let's say I'm looking for two types of jobs,

35
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:37,001
one working as an office assistant

36
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,000
and the other as a teaching assistant.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,002
These are different jobs.

38
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,008
So I'll separate my notebook

39
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:44,002
into an office assistant section

40
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,004
and a teaching assistant section.

41
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:49,002
I'm most interested in the office assistant job,

42
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:51,004
so I'll start with that section.

43
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:55,008
I'll name this section office assistant and select OK.

44
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:58,000
So now I have a new section in my notebook

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,001
called office assistant.

46
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,009
When a new section is created,

47
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:06,006
OneNote automatically adds a page called Untitled Page,

48
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,000
which I'll update here

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
to specify what type of notes I'll include.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,009
Let's say job details.

51
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,007
Now that this page is set up,

52
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,007
I'm ready to take notes on the job opportunity.

53
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,004
Now that you know how to create a notebook

54
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:21,008
and sections within it,

55
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,000
you can make your own digital notebooks.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,009
These will be places

57
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:27,001
where you can keep notes on job searches,

58
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,008
classes you're taking,

59
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:31,003
or which new series you want to binge watch.
