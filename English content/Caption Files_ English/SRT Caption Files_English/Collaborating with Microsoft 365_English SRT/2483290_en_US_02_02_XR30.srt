00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] When you're keeping track of numbers

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,007
in a spreadsheet, Excel can save you time

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:10,003
by doing the math quickly and accurately for you,

4
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:13,000
with something as important and detailed

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,009
as your monthly expenses, having everything added up

6
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:21,007
automatically, helps you make sense of all that information.

7
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,003
With the sum function

8
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:27,006
you can easily add large amounts of data together.

9
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:28,007
In this lesson,

10
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:32,002
I'll show you how to use this powerful tool

11
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,004
to transform an extended list of numbers

12
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:38,005
into a simple sum total.

13
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,008
To get started, download the exercise file

14
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:45,008
and pull up the sample budget in Excel.

15
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:48,007
The sample budget contains a list of expenses

16
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,006
and each expense has a cost next to it.

17
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:54,001
If you want to know how much you'll need to pay

18
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,001
for all these expenses

19
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,008
you'll need to know the total cost in one single value,

20
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:03,005
that's where the sum function can help.

21
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,006
First consider where you want the total amount

22
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:07,002
to be displayed,

23
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:11,004
I'll choose cell E 2 as the home for this sum function

24
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,002
so it's at the top and easy to find.

25
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,009
Now you'll need to determine

26
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,005
either the exact cells to add up or the range

27
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:23,002
of numbers you want to add, where they begin and end.

28
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:25,003
In this example of monthly expenses

29
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,008
I want to include every item in the total sum.

30
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:33,006
Those expenses start at cell B 2 and end at cell B 8,

31
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:36,005
so I'll use this as the range of data.

32
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,005
Now it's time to put a formula to work

33
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,005
and create a sum function.

34
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:45,004
First, select on the cell where you want to place your sum,

35
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:51,006
type in =sum then open parentheses

36
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:53,005
which tells the program that you want

37
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:57,001
the total amount of whatever will be inside the parentheses.

38
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,002
Once that open parentheses is added, I'm able to specify

39
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:04,002
the range by selecting the first cell, B 2,

40
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:08,002
and dragging down to the final cell, B 8.

41
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:12,003
I'll close the parentheses, press enter,

42
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,004
and the sum will populate.

43
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,005
I'll add a title for my total expenses

44
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:19,002
so I know what's captured in the cell.

45
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,009
If you wanted non-consecutive numbers summed up instead

46
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,004
of adding a range of cells to the parentheses

47
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:27,000
just type the cells that you want in that space.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
For example, if I only wanted to know the cost

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,009
for housing and transportation,

50
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,005
I would first select the cell

51
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:35,009
where I want to view my sum,

52
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:48,009
type =sum open parentheses, then select B2, add a comma,

53
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:57,001
then select B5, close parenthesis, press enter,

54
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,006
and those two cells will be added together.

55
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:02,007
Now you can use the sum function

56
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:06,007
anytime you need to quickly add values to Excel,

57
00:03:06,007 --> 00:03:09,000
no calculator needed.
