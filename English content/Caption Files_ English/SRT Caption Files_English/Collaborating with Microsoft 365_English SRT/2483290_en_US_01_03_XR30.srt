00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Instructor] Picture this.

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:05,001
You just updated your resume to apply for a new job.

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:08,007
All the details look great, except there's one problem.

4
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,003
Your resume's spread over two pages

5
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:16,005
and the job application asks for one page max.

6
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,001
By adjusting the margins,

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,007
you can keep everything on the same page

8
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:23,003
without deleting anything important.

9
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to use margins

10
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:30,000
to fit the content you want in the space you need.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
To get started, download the sample resume

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,004
available in the Exercise Files.

13
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:38,001
The first thing you need to do is open the resume.

14
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,009
Since this is such an important document,

15
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,004
make sure to review it closely

16
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:46,008
to make sure it has all the necessary information.

17
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,007
This layout looks good,

18
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,004
but there's a little bit of text

19
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:54,001
running onto the second page.

20
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,009
So to keep everything on one page without deleting anything,

21
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,003
you want to customize your margins.

22
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll show you how by going up to the ribbon

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,005
and selecting Layout.

24
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,001
This is where Word displays several options

25
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,009
for how text is arranged on the page.

26
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,007
You can explore all these features on your own,

27
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:15,009
but for now, just select Margins.

28
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,009
From here, you can choose pre-made margins

29
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,007
or Custom Margins.

30
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:23,006
I'll choose Custom Margins to give myself more flexibility.

31
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,001
When I select Margins,

32
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,008
a window appears showing the current margins.

33
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:28,009
The bigger your margins are,

34
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,009
the less room you'll have for text on a page,

35
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,002
but making them smaller will allow you

36
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:37,004
to fit more text in the same space.

37
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,003
Since I need to fit all the text

38
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:41,002
onto a single sheet of paper,

39
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,001
these margins need to be smaller.

40
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,009
I'll lower the default margins from one inch

41
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,006
down to a half an inch.

42
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:52,005
After selecting OK

43
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:56,004
to apply the updated margins to your document,

44
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:59,006
the resume now fits on one page.

45
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,005
If you need to adjust the margins again,

46
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,009
you can always go back into Custom Margins

47
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,002
and make any changes you need.

48
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,005
Now you know exactly how to adjust the margins

49
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:09,005
in a Word document

50
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,003
and get everything you need on the same page.

51
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,007
You're ready to reformat your resume

52
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,009
or any other document.
