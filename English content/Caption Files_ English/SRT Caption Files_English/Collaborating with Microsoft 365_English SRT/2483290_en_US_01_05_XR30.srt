00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Host] Believe it or not,

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,002
there are still many reasons

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,002
why a file living on your computer, tablet or phone

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:10,009
needs to jump off the screen and onto a sheet of paper.

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,006
Perhaps you need to add a handwritten signature

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:17,003
to an agreement or give a hard copy of your resume

7
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:18,008
to a hiring manager.

8
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:22,009
In these situations, you just need to press print.

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,002
After watching this lesson,

10
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:27,003
you'll know the steps to print your word documents,

11
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:31,007
bringing them off the screen and into the physical world.

12
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,000
A common document that needs to be shared physically

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,005
is a job resume.

14
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,005
So I'll walk you through how to print using a sample resume.

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,007
To begin, download the sample resume

16
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,003
available in the exercise files and open it up.

17
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,004
I won't be able to make any changes

18
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:50,004
once this resume is printed on a piece of paper.

19
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:53,001
So I want to take a moment to review my resume

20
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,003
and make sure I'm ready to press print.

21
00:00:56,003 --> 00:01:00,001
Once I'm certain that this document is exactly how I want,

22
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,004
I'll go to the ribbon and select file.

23
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,005
From here, you can choose to create a new file,

24
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:11,008
open an existing file, save, share, export, or print.

25
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:14,006
To hold a copy of this document in my hand,

26
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:20,003
I'll need to choose print and then print this document.

27
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,008
Now a new screen appears that displays an image

28
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,007
of what the printout will look like,

29
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:28,008
as well as additional options and settings on the left.

30
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:31,007
Next, make sure the destination is set

31
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,004
for the correct printer.

32
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:35,005
With the destination set correctly,

33
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,004
and the preview looking right,

34
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,007
you are just about ready to print.

35
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:42,002
Leave the pages option to all.

36
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,006
If you had a multi-page document,

37
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:46,005
you'd use this option to specify

38
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,007
which pages you wanted to print,

39
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,005
but that's not right for my resume.

40
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:52,006
So I'll leave it as one.

41
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,003
At this point, if you select print,

42
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,009
the printing process will be underway.

43
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,000
If you want to go beyond a standard print

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,008
you can select print using system dialogue,

45
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:04,009
where you can change the layout of your document

46
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,005
from portrait to landscape, print only specific pages,

47
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:11,000
or make any other advanced adjustments.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,009
Printing your documents is less common with PDFs and email,

49
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:17,002
but it's still a great way to make sure your document

50
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,004
looks exactly how you created it.

51
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:20,007
When you print a document,

52
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,007
you're bringing your digital work into the physical world

53
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,000
and that's amazing.
