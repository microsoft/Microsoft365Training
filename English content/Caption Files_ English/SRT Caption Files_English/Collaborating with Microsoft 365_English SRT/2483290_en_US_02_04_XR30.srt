00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,005
- [Instructor] The first step to understanding data

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:05,000
is organizing it in a spreadsheet,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,005
but in order to understand what the data really means,

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,009
you'll want to learn how to visualize it.

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,002
It can be difficult to get a full picture

6
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:16,005
of monthly expenses just by looking at a worksheet.

7
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:19,005
In this example, I'll bring that data into a chart,

8
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:22,002
so that I can get clarity on key trends,

9
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,001
how much money is being spent,

10
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,007
what can be done differently in the future?

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,008
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how

12
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:32,001
to use Excel's charts to visualize data,

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,007
adding a different view and a new understanding

14
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,001
to simple numbers on a spreadsheet.

15
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,009
So, go ahead and download the sample budget workbook

16
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:43,009
and the exercise files, so that you can follow along.

17
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,004
The first thing to do is select the data.

18
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,005
I know I want to have a clearer understanding

19
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,000
of my monthly expenses, so I'll highlight

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,004
my monthly expenses table.

21
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:59,001
I'll select and drag to include the full range.

22
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:04,000
With the data selected, go to the ribbon and select insert.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,007
A new ribbon has opened here, with a few options.

24
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:09,003
I'm looking for a visual representation

25
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,003
of how my money is spent each month,

26
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:14,007
so a pie chart would be the best choice for me.

27
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:20,001
So, I'll select pie chart and select 2-D Pie.

28
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,005
We're going to make my chart a little smaller,

29
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,008
so we can see it.

30
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:29,000
You can also drag and drop your chart to move it around.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
From here, I can see how much of my monthly expenses

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
fall into each category.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,002
Now, that I've made my data visual in a chart,

34
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:39,000
it's easy for me to see if any of my expenses

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,007
need to be adjusted.

36
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:45,004
Looking at how much I spend in entertainment,

37
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,006
I think that might be a piece of my budget

38
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:50,000
where I can make some adjustments.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,009
Now that you know how to add a chart,

40
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,007
you can make visual representations

41
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,006
of your own data in a worksheet,

42
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:58,006
or try adding a chart to the sample budget.

43
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:00,008
Experiment with different types of charts

44
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,002
to see what they look like

45
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,007
and visualize your data in new ways.
