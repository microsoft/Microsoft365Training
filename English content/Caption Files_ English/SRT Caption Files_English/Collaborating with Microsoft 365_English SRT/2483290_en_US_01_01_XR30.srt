00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,008
- [Instructor] Many times, the most difficult part

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,006
of creating something is getting started.

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:08,000
You can have all the best ideas,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,001
but unless you know the direction you want to go,

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,003
taking the first step can be intimidating.

6
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,008
Word templates.

7
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:18,009
Take the guesswork out of the first step

8
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:22,003
and help you craft great-looking documents,

9
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:25,004
freeing you up to focus on your content.

10
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,008
After this lesson,

11
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,002
you'll be ready to take advantage of templates

12
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:32,004
and make your project stand out.

13
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:37,002
To get started, in the top left corner of office.com,

14
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:42,001
select the app launcher and open Word.

15
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:47,000
Once Word opens, you can choose a blank document,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,005
meaning you're starting from scratch,

17
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,004
or choose a pre-made template.

18
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,000
A template is a sample document

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,002
that you can customize to make your own.

20
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,002
In this example, I'm beginning a job search.

21
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:06,003
So I want to make a resume, also known as a CV,

22
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:08,006
using templates.

23
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:11,004
These templates are great,

24
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,006
but they're not quite what I'm envisioning.

25
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:18,009
So I'll select More templates.

26
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,005
I like the look of the Resume green template,

27
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,007
so I'll choose that one.

28
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,003
The new document opens

29
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,004
and starts with the standard resume layout.

30
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:35,001
Now, before I get too far, I'll rename and save my document.

31
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,001
Simply select the document name.

32
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,005
I'll name this one My Resume,

33
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:45,001
and I can see that it is saved.

34
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,001
Now, as you can see,

35
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,002
the template not only comes

36
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:52,008
with a well-formatted example of a resume,

37
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:55,001
but inside each section,

38
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:57,006
the template includes directions to follow.

39
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:00,006
For example, in the Objective section,

40
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,008
this template shows the title

41
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:06,006
and in the body clearly tells you what to put there.

42
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:09,009
If you have an old resume that needs an upgrade,

43
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,004
you can copy the content from that old resume

44
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:13,009
into the new template.

45
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:17,001
Simply copy the content from the old resume

46
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:21,000
and paste it as text into the template.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,004
For now, I'll just add new content.

48
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll start by adding the simplest text in first,

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,008
starting with my name.

50
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:33,002
First, I highlight the text I want to replace

51
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,006
and type in my name.

52
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,008
I see for Experience,

53
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:43,004
there's a section for job title and job position.

54
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:46,003
I only need job title for experience,

55
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:51,006
so I'll delete job position by using Cut.

56
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:55,002
I will also duplicate the text in Experience

57
00:02:55,002 --> 00:03:00,006
using Copy and Paste.

58
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:03,001
Now, I have space for two jobs.

59
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:06,002
I don't need the Communication section,

60
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,001
so I'll just cut this section.

61
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:11,002
After replacing the text and the template

62
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,008
with my own content,

63
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:15,006
I will have a beautifully put together resume,

64
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:17,004
and I didn't have to think twice

65
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:20,009
about the font style, size, margins,

66
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,004
or any other formatting.

67
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:25,004
The template had that figured out already.

68
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,006
Now that I've walked you through the simple process

69
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,007
of creating and editing a template,

70
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:31,009
you're ready to try it out on your own.

71
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:35,000
What documents can you make better by using templates?

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,001
Practice your skills by moving an existing document

73
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,006
into a new template

74
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:42,003
and see your content get a fresh format.
