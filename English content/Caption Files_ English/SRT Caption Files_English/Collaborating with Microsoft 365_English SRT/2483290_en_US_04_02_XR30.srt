00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:02,009
- [Instructor] Sometimes an email can say it all,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,009
but for those times

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,007
when you need to say a bit more,

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,008
attaching a file can help you add

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,004
even more important information.

6
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:12,002
In this lesson,

7
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,003
I'm going to show you how to use Outlook

8
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,003
to send attachments

9
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,001
so that you can easily include

10
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,001
relevant files with your email

11
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,003
To show you how to use attachments,

12
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:23,008
I'm going to use the example

13
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,005
of trying to look for a new job.

14
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,002
I heard of a new opportunity,

15
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,004
and I'll need to attach my resume

16
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:33,000
to an email to share it.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,008
First, I'll open Outlook.

18
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,004
From my Outlook inbox,

19
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,005
I'll open the email that I need to reply to.

20
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,009
I'll select reply,

21
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,005
and then I'll select add attachment.

22
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,002
A menu opens to help me find

23
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,007
the file I'm looking for.

24
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,004
Since I saved my document to Microsoft's

25
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:54,006
file hosting service OneDrive,

26
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:57,006
I'll select browse cloud locations.

27
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:00,003
I'll navigate to the file I'll need.

28
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:04,006
Select it and select next.

29
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,009
Now I can choose if I want to share a link

30
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,000
to my file or a copy of it.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If I was working on editing the file

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
with someone else,

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,003
I would share a link,

34
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,005
that way we could work on the file together,

35
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,006
and see updates in real time.

36
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,009
Since I'm sharing my resume

37
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,003
with a potential employer,

38
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,008
and we don't need to collaborate on the document,

39
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:25,005
I will choose attached as copy.

40
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:28,003
My resume is now attached to my email.

41
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:30,001
I'm ready to send it.

42
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,006
So I select send and my email and attachment

43
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,003
are on their way.

44
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:39,001
Try adding an attachment to your next email.
