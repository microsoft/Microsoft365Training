00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,008
- [Instructor] Data is everywhere in the digital world.

2
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:07,009
With so much information on your screens and in your life,

3
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,005
it can be tough to keep track of everything.

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,007
What's great about Excel is that once you have your data

5
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:17,002
on a table, it's much easier to organize

6
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,005
and locate what you're looking for.

7
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:20,009
In this lesson,

8
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:24,007
I'm going to show you how to sort your data in a table

9
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,001
to find the information you need.

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,009
To get started, download and open

11
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:33,002
the sample budget exercise file in Excel.

12
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:35,009
Now that I have the document open,

13
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,004
you can see that expense items

14
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:41,007
and amounts are already formatted as a table,

15
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,008
but they're not in any particular order.

16
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,009
I want to see my most expensive expense.

17
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,009
So I'll need to use sort and filter.

18
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:55,003
Sorting allows you to organize the data in a specific order.

19
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:58,006
To sort my data, I'll go to the header of my table

20
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:01,006
and select the Filter and Sort button

21
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:04,000
on the column I want to sort.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,007
In the menu that appears,

23
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:09,003
I can choose from a variety of ways to sort the data.

24
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:12,009
Because I want to see my most expensive items first,

25
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,009
I'll select Sort Largest to Smallest.

26
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,004
Now, the expenses are sorted

27
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:21,005
from the highest expense to the lowest expense.

28
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,008
Sorting in this way can come in handy

29
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:26,003
when prioritizing which expenses

30
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,004
have the highest impact on a monthly budget.

31
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,007
In addition to sorting expenses by cost,

32
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:35,004
you can also sort them by name.

33
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:39,007
To sort by name, return to the top of the items column,

34
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:44,008
select Filter and Sort, and choose Sort A to Z.

35
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, instead of the list being in order

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,001
from most expensive to least,

37
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,000
the budget items are sorted alphabetically.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,001
This is useful if you have a long list of items

39
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,004
and you want to find one by name.

40
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:01,003
You can also filter the data in a table.

41
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:04,002
Filtering allows you to more easily see the data

42
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:08,005
you're looking for by temporarily limiting what's visible.

43
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,009
For example, I can filter my table

44
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,003
to only show the expenses that are $200.

45
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:17,009
Simply select the Filter and Sort button,

46
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,002
deselect Select All,

47
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:25,007
and select $200 and select Apply.

48
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:29,004
This will show only the expenses that are $200.

49
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,001
I can select

50
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:36,002
Select All to select all of my expenses again.

51
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:39,001
Now that you know how to sort and filter data in Excel,

52
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,003
you can arrange any type of data

53
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:42,009
in a way that works for you.
