00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Zakiya] In every changing world,

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,007
there are always new things to be learned.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:09,000
As technology advances and new roles are in demand each day,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,002
building on existing skills and learning new ones

5
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,007
is necessary to keep up.

6
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,006
You deserve all that comes with new opportunities

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,005
and you can do it.

8
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:22,003
My name is Zakiya Mackey and I've built my career

9
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:25,006
helping others build new skills, broaden their horizons,

10
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,002
and learn new tips for success.

11
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:32,002
In this course I'll cover some Microsoft 365 products

12
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,001
that will help in any tech based role.

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,007
I'll also help you use existing products

14
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:39,004
for maximum efficiency,

15
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:42,003
share best practices and industry standards,

16
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,002
as well as some pointers to optimize your workflow

17
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,000
in the workplace.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,006
When you level up your workflow,

19
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,007
you can change your career trajectory

20
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,003
and become more successful.

21
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:57,002
I want you to be able to use Microsoft 365 tools

22
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:00,000
to stay organized, engage your audience,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,003
and collaborate with others more effectively.

24
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,005
Let's get to it.
