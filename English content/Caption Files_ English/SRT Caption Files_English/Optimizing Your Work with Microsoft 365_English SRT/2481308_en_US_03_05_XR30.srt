00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,003
- [Instructor] Creating and delivering presentations

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,000
is an important skill to have in the workplace.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,007
When you create a presentation,

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,008
you need to consider accessibility

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,007
to ensure it has an inclusive delivery format.

6
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:14,007
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,005
how to make your presentations more accessible

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,001
and make sure no one is left out.

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:24,001
Before I dive in, I want to review a few key terms.

10
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,004
The accessibility checker allows you

11
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:30,005
to review the accessibility of your presentation.

12
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:34,008
It suggests how to address issues using alternative text

13
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,007
with all visual elements.

14
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,009
When you use the accessibility checker,

15
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,008
you'll see an accessibility panel with four areas -

16
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:47,004
errors, warnings, tips and intelligent services.

17
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,008
Errors are elements of your presentation

18
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,008
that make it difficult for someone to use.

19
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:55,009
Warnings include content that could be difficult

20
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,007
for people with disabilities to understand

21
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:01,005
which could be related to contrast or format.

22
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,003
Tips: Address accessibility issues

23
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,002
which could be better presented or described.

24
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:10,002
Intelligent services uses alternative text

25
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:13,004
to describe low vision images or graphics.

26
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:17,004
And alternative text or alt text for short

27
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:21,002
is descriptive text which conveys the meaning and context

28
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,000
of a visual item in a digital setting.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,004
Alt text allows screen reader software

30
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:29,008
to describe the images and other non-text content

31
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:32,000
that a user cannot see.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,007
Okay, now I want to show you these tools in action.

33
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:39,004
To start, open the presentation in PowerPoint.

34
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:42,001
Follow along by downloading the sample presentation

35
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,008
in your exercise files.

36
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:51,003
It's called Customer Event Example (B).

37
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:54,001
Go to the top ribbon and select review,

38
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,007
then check accessibility.

39
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,002
The accessibility panel appears on the right of the screen

40
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:00,009
next to the slide.

41
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,008
This presentation has errors and warnings.

42
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,009
First, I'll select the error icon

43
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,005
to see what the error is and how it can be addressed.

44
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:15,001
The error states missing alternative text.

45
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:20,001
This means alt text needs to be added to the image.

46
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,009
Select it and PowerPoint takes you to the error

47
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,003
on the presentation.

48
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:31,001
Right-click the image and select alt text

49
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,008
and enter a short description.

50
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:36,008
It's best to convey the content and purpose of the image

51
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:41,003
with a short description, no more than two sentences long.

52
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:48,002
I'll type, handshake with people.

53
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:52,001
I can also select the generate a description for me button

54
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,006
underneath the description box.

55
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:59,007
I'll delete what I just typed.

56
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:02,004
And select generate a description for me

57
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:09,008
and watch the alt text appear beneath the image.

58
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:14,009
Okay, the error is resolved so I can close the alt text box

59
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,006
and select recheck in the accessibility window.

60
00:03:17,006 --> 00:03:20,001
Select the warnings button.

61
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,003
The accessibility checker tells me that

62
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:25,009
there is hard to read text contrast.

63
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:29,001
I'll select the dropdown and select this issue.

64
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,002
The table has contrast issues

65
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,007
which means the colors are too similar.

66
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:36,008
To fix this, select the table,

67
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:40,000
navigate to the top ribbon and select table.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,003
From here, select cell shading

69
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:46,000
and pick a color that has a deeper tone

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,007
to differentiate the colors.

71
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:51,009
I'll choose blue.

72
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:57,001
I'll select recheck again, and see the warning is gone.

73
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:59,006
When it comes time to deliver your presentation,

74
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:02,009
it's important to consider those with hearing difficulties.

75
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,005
Adding subtitles ensures that everyone can follow along

76
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:09,006
with what is being said during the presentation.

77
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:14,005
To add subtitles, go to the slideshow tab on the top ribbon.

78
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,007
Select always use subtitles

79
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:26,003
and then, the spoken and subtitle languages in the dropdown.

80
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:29,004
You can also specify where the subtitles will appear

81
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:37,002
and which microphone the app will use.

82
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:40,007
Now when you're presenting, the microphone icon will be red

83
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:43,007
to indicate that it is live and ready for you to speak.

84
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:45,009
It will pick up your voice as you present

85
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:49,005
and the corresponding subtitles will appear.

86
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:54,001
Calendars help people organize their schedules.

87
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:57,000
Make sure to speak clearly and slowly

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,001
so that your voice is picked up appropriately.

89
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,009
If you want to turn off the subtitles

90
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,009
during your presentation, select the use subtitles button

91
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:09,002
indicated by a monitor icon on the toolbar

92
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:11,006
in the lower left corner.

93
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:14,001
Try using these accessibility features

94
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:15,007
in your next presentation

95
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:18,003
to help you share your ideas inclusively.
