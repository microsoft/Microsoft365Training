- [Instructor] And now we've reached the end of this course,

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,005
but it's not the end of your journey.

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,008
There will always be new things to learn

00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,005
I want to leave you with some resources

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,005
that will help you along your way.

00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,006
First, I recommend that you check out

00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,009
the Microsoft Community page and join the conversation.

00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:20,009
The Microsoft Community is a great place

10
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,009
to find quick tips and solutions

00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,006
to typical issues that you encounter.

12
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,005
You can ask questions of the support team

13
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,004
as well as speak to other users just like you.

14
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:34,002
And lastly, explore the products and make mistakes.

15
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:35,008
It's only through making mistakes

16
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,006
that you can learn how to troubleshoot

17
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:40,000
and solve problems on your own.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,007
I know that you have the ability and skill

19
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,006
