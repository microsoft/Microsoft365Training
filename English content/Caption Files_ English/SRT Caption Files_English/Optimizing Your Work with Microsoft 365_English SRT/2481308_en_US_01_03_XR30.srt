00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] Have you ever wanted to create a to-do list

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,001
or create reminders

3
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,001
to help you accomplish your tasks on time?

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,009
I know I need a tool to keep me on track.

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:12,000
Using to-do lists in Outlook is a great way to stay on top

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,007
of your communications and priorities.

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,000
After this lesson,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,002
you'll be able to create your first to-do list

9
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:21,000
and use it to accomplish your tasks.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,004
Microsoft To Do is integrated with Outlook on the web

11
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,007
and includes smart lists.

12
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:29,001
Smart lists are filtered lists that make it easier

13
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,002
to track tasks and organize your day.

14
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,006
With To Do integration,

15
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:36,002
you can quickly organize your tasks by adding them

16
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,007
to my day, marking them as important

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,006
or adding them to new lists that you create.

18
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:44,005
I'll start from the Microsoft 365 homepage

19
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:49,004
and then open Outlook.

20
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,005
Building a to-do list in Outlook takes a few steps.

21
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:56,000
The first thing to do is create tasks in my day;

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,004
tasks are individual items on your to-do list.

23
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,008
In this example, I'll build a task list

24
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,003
for an event that I'm organizing.

25
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,008
Start from the Outlook inbox, select the my day icon

26
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:15,005
in the top ribbon indicated by a calendar with a check,

27
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:20,008
and then select add a task.

28
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,007
Here you can enter the task.

29
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:33,004
I'll type order round tables, and select Add.

30
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,003
Your task is now added to the list.

31
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,009
Next, navigate to the bottom of tasks

32
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,004
and select manage all tasks.

33
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,003
Microsoft To Do opens a new window

34
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,004
for you to edit your task.

35
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:55,006
I'm going to select tasks and the menu to the left

36
00:01:55,006 --> 00:02:00,001
and then the new task order round tables,

37
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,006
and a panel opens to the right.

38
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:06,006
Here you can add a step, add a reminder, due date,

39
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:11,000
repetition category, or add a file.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,001
I'm going to set a reminder

41
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:20,006
for later today and add a due date for tomorrow.

42
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,002
When you finished,

43
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:25,005
navigate to your inbox by selecting the envelope icon

44
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:32,002
at the bottom left of the screen.

45
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,001
To see your task and to-do list,

46
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:40,005
select the my day icon on the top ribbon.

47
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:42,004
And it will appear in the task list

48
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:45,008
with the reminder and the due date set.

49
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:48,005
You can also convert an email into a task.

50
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,007
You can do this by having my day open,

51
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,000
then selecting the email,

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,006
and dragging it to the tasks.

53
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,001
You can right click on the task

54
00:02:56,001 --> 00:03:01,001
to add the appropriate details.

55
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,007
Now, that you've made the task,

56
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,008
when you're finished select the X

57
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:09,003
and the task list will close.

58
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,005
By using to-do lists and reminders,

59
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:13,008
you can stay up to date with communications

60
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,003
and action items assigned

61
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:18,003
to certain tasks and conversations.

62
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:20,007
Using the skill will help you prioritize your work

63
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,003
and manage time.

64
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:23,002
Try it out

65
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,008
by creating a task that you need to complete this week.
