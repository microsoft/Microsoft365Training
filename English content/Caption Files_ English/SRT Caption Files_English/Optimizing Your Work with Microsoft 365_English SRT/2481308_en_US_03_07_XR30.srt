00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] Depending on the audience

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,006
and your familiarity with the content,

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:07,002
creating a presentation can be a nerve-wracking experience.

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,006
Is this the right info?

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,006
Is that the right format to use?

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:14,002
Thankfully PowerPoint can take away some of these questions

7
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:17,003
and make presentation creation a breeze.

8
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:20,009
In this lesson, I'm going to share some best practices

9
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:23,001
so that you can become a better presenter

10
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:27,000
and deliver a clear message in every presentation you give.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,002
To start I'm going to open a PowerPoint presentation.

12
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:32,002
You can follow along

13
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:35,001
with the sample presentation in your exercise files.

14
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,006
It's called customer event example A.

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,009
First consider what style and font to use.

16
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,008
You want to make sure

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,001
that your audience will be able to read from a distance.

18
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,008
I recommend using a font style that is not too decorative

19
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,009
in a size between 20 and 24 point.

20
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:57,001
To adjust the font and style size, I'll navigate

21
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:01,001
to the top ribbon and make sure home is selected.

22
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:06,003
From here I'll highlight the text in the slide

23
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,003
and select the font

24
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:13,000
and size from the dropdown menu in the home tab.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Next use bullet points

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,004
and short sentences to share your information.

27
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:21,005
A minimal amount of text on your slide is the way to go

28
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,006
to keep your audience engaged.

29
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:27,000
I recommend that each idea should fit on one line.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,008
To emphasize points and help tell a story, use pictures,

31
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,006
graphics, charts, and graphs.

32
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:36,002
Be sure to add labels to help your audience

33
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:39,006
identify the purpose of the visual elements.

34
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:42,007
It's also important to keep backgrounds subtle and uniform.

35
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:45,007
Keeping your background colors subtle will help

36
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:49,001
your audience focus on the points in the presentation.

37
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,005
To edit your background

38
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:54,005
navigate to the design tab and select background.

39
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:58,007
A solid fill is usually the least distracting.

40
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:02,005
Next, use themes to set a high contrast

41
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,005
between the background color and the text color.

42
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:06,008
To change your theme

43
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:09,002
open your existing PowerPoint presentation,

44
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:11,006
navigate to design in the top ribbon,

45
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,003
and select a theme from the dropdown menu.

46
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,003
I also recommend

47
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,004
that you use the accessibility checker.

48
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,007
Navigate to the top ribbon, select review,

49
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,004
and then check accessibility.

50
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,007
PowerPoint will give you tips to address any errors

51
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:29,000
that might make it hard for anyone to view.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Next, use the presenter coach

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,006
to practice your presentation delivery.

54
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,007
To access the presenter coach

55
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,007
go to the slideshow tab in the top ribbon

56
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:41,005
and select rehearse with coach.

57
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,004
When your presentation appears,

58
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:49,002
you can practice your delivery by selecting start rehearsal.

59
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,009
After you finish the rehearsal report will give you

60
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:55,009
information like your pace, pronunciation, pitch,

61
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,008
and time spent to support you as you work

62
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:03,006
to perfect your presentation skills and style.

63
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,005
Next, use your notes.

64
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,005
Don't just read the text on the slides word for word.

65
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:11,002
Practice what you'll say about the key points

66
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:14,007
so you don't get confused or miss any relevant information

67
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:16,005
while you're presenting.

68
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:18,006
To add notes to your presentation

69
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:24,005
navigate to the view tab in the top ribbon and select notes.

70
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,004
Now go forth and practice your presentation.
