00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] Delivering a PowerPoint presentation,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,002
is an exciting experience.

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:06,005
You've put time into creating the presentation,

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:09,001
and now it's time to share it with others.

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,001
With speaker notes and PowerPoint,

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,003
you can have access to key talking points

7
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:15,006
and important information you're presenting,

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,006
no memorization needed.

9
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,005
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

10
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,003
how to add and use speaker notes

11
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:24,002
and share your presentation with others.

12
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:26,008
First, I'm going to open a PowerPoint presentation.

13
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,002
Follow along by downloading the sample presentation

14
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:30,008
in your exercise files,

15
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:36,002
it's called customer event example A.

16
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,007
To create speaker notes in the presentation,

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:42,004
I'll navigate to the top open and select the view tab.

18
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:47,001
Next, select the notes under the top ribbon beneath file.

19
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,005
The notes pane appears across the bottom portion

20
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,001
of the PowerPoint window.

21
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,001
With the cursor blinking and ready for me to begin typing,

22
00:00:54,001 --> 00:01:00,008
I'll input my speaker notes.

23
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,009
If I don't need the notes to be visible,

24
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:05,006
I can select the notes tab again

25
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,001
and the notes pane will disappear.

26
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,006
If I'm presenting in PowerPoint online,

27
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:13,008
I will only be able to see notes from the notes pane.

28
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,008
You can have them visible while editing and when printing

29
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,006
but not while presenting.

30
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:21,008
Printed speaker notes are good resource to have for yourself

31
00:01:21,008 --> 00:01:23,003
while presenting or if you need

32
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,004
to share the presentation with notes.

33
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,006
To print your slides with notes,

34
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:30,008
navigate to the top ribbon and select file.

35
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,000
Next select print.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,009
Then print note pages.

37
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,002
When printing your notes, each slide will have its own page

38
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:45,002
with the appropriate notes underneath the slide.

39
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:49,007
You can also print the presentation as handouts.

40
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:50,007
To print handouts,

41
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:53,007
I'll go to the top ribbon and select file,

42
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:57,007
then print, then print handouts.

43
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:00,008
The printed page will print with three slides per page

44
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,000
and lines for personal note taking

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,001
to the right of each slide.

46
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,001
To share the presentation virtually,

47
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:13,002
I'll navigate to the top ribbon and select file, then share.

48
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:16,008
Next, select share with people.

49
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:20,004
From here I can enter the names or email addresses

50
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:24,008
of the people I want to share with.

51
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:26,001
To modify permissions,

52
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:33,004
select the dropdown menu next to the pencil icon.

53
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:43,008
I'll include a message to describe the presentation,

54
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:47,009
and select send.

55
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,008
Alternatively, I can select copy link

56
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:53,006
to create a link that I can copy to an email

57
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:57,003
to share the presentation.

58
00:02:57,003 --> 00:03:00,002
Having your notes and knowing how to share your presentation

59
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:04,001
sets you up for a smooth delivery of your information.

60
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,002
Try sharing your slides and notes

61
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:08,001
the next time you have a presentation.
