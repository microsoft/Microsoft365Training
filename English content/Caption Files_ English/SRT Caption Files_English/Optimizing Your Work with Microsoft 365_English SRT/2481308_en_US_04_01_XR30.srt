00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,005
- [Instructor] Having the skills to create great documents

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:05,000
puts you on the path to great results.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,006
Adding structure and media to your documents

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,007
can help bring clarity to your work

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,009
and make it more organized.

6
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,001
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,001
how to incorporate formatting techniques

8
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:17,007
into your documents

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:21,008
so they are easy to navigate and understand.

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:25,008
I'll start from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

11
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:29,006
In this example, I'm going to enhance and invent itinerary

12
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:32,001
with some photos and formatting.

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,008
Follow along by downloading the sample word document

14
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,009
in your exercise files.

15
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:47,004
It's called Customer Event Itinerary Example (A).

16
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,003
To add a picture to a document,

17
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:53,008
I'll place my cursor where I want the image.

18
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:59,007
Navigate to the top ribbon in word and select insert,

19
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:03,009
then picture.

20
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,001
Then I'll need to choose the source of the image

21
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,007
from these options.

22
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:12,008
This device, one drive, stock images, and bing pictures.

23
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:14,003
I need to find a picture.

24
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:20,001
So I'm going to select stock images.

25
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:23,003
When the stock images window appears, use the search bar

26
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,009
to find the kind of picture you are looking for.

27
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:30,009
I'll type travel.

28
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:38,009
Once I find the photo, I'll select insert.

29
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,002
And it's added into the document where the cursor is placed.

30
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:47,009
To resize the photo, select it,

31
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,006
and navigate to the top ribbon under picture

32
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:55,001
for formatting options.

33
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:59,003
There are lots of editing options, photo size modifications,

34
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,007
border additions, photo enhancements,

35
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:05,000
and how text appears relative to the photo.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,005
I can also resize the photo manually

37
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,006
by dragging the white dots on the sides

38
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,007
and corners of the photo.

39
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,007
Adding titles at the header or footer of your document

40
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,009
can be helpful with keeping related topics organized

41
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,008
and give your document a clear, easy to follow format.

42
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:25,009
The header is located in the top margin of your document,

43
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:29,002
and the footer is in the bottom margin.

44
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:32,002
To add titles to the header or footer of your document,

45
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:35,009
select insert on the top ribbon in Word,

46
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:40,002
then select header and footer.

47
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,006
From here, you can place the cursor

48
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,009
in the header or footer of the page

49
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,002
which is distinguished by shading out the body text

50
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:52,001
and you're ready to type directly into each.

51
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to add my name to the header

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,006
and format it to appear on every page

53
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,005
by selecting same across entire document

54
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:03,007
under the options dropdown menu on the right.

55
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,004
So after you add your text,

56
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:07,008
you can choose how you want it formatted.

57
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,009
I'll make my name bold by highlighting the text

58
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:15,008
and selecting bold in the menu that appears above my cursor.

59
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:18,004
Next I'll select the shaded text

60
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:22,003
to return to the body of the document.

61
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:26,002
Now all the pages of my document have the same header.

62
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:29,007
To see this, go to view in the top ribbon

63
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:37,004
and select reading view.

64
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,004
To exit out of reading view,

65
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:43,008
navigate to the top ribbon and select edit document,

66
00:03:43,008 --> 00:03:51,004
then edit in the dropdown menu.

67
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:55,000
I can also add page numbers to headers and footers.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,001
I'll navigate to the top ribbon and select insert,

69
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,002
and then select page numbers.

70
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:04,002
This dropdown menu provides options for placement

71
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,008
of the page numbers.

72
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:09,003
I'll select add page number to the center of the footer

73
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:16,000
and Word adds the appropriate page numbers to each page.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,007
To see this, go to view in the top ribbon

75
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:28,005
and select reading view.

76
00:04:28,005 --> 00:04:30,002
To exit out of reading view,

77
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:35,000
navigate to the top ribbon and select edit document.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,002
Then edit in the dropdown menu.

79
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,007
And when I no longer need page numbers,

80
00:04:44,007 --> 00:04:49,005
I'll navigate to the top ribbon, select insert,

81
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,009
page numbers,

82
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:58,007
then select remove page numbers under the options.

83
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:03,000
Next, a page break creates separation within a document

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,005
and can be used to introduce a new idea

85
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,006
or start new chapters or pages.

86
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:11,001
To add a page break, place your cursor

87
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:15,004
where you want one page to begin and the other to end.

88
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:20,002
Next, navigate to insert and then select page break

89
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:23,001
for the page break to appear.

90
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:24,009
When printing the document,

91
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:28,000
the break doesn't visually appear.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,007
To remove the page break,

93
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:33,000
double click the break you want to remove

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,001
and then press delete on your keyboard.

95
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,000
Adding pictures and formatting can significantly enhance

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,009
the information shared in your document.

97
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,008
Try formatting or adding pictures

98
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:46,007
to liven up your next document.
