00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] Animations and transitions

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,006
are key tools to make your presentations flow.

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:07,008
In this lesson, I'll show you how to apply animations

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,001
to different elements and set transitions

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:14,008
between slides that support, not distract the presentation.

6
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:16,008
First, open PowerPoint.

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,001
You can follow along with the sample presentation

8
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,008
in your exercise files,

9
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:25,001
it's called customer event example A.

10
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:26,003
In this example,

11
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:27,006
I'll be using a presentation

12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,003
for a customer event I'm organizing.

13
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,001
To add a transition to your slide,

14
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,003
open the slide where you want a transition.

15
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:38,000
The transition will begin on the proceeding slide

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,001
and conclude on the slide you select.

17
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,003
Next, go to the transitions tab in the top ribbon

18
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:47,008
and find the effect that you want in the transition gallery.

19
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:51,000
To see more options, select the dropdown menu.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,001
I'll select morph.

21
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,009
After you've chosen your transition,

22
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,008
select the options tab next to the transition gallery

23
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,004
to specify how the transition occurs.

24
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,009
I'll select objects.

25
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,002
To set how fast a transition goes,

26
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:10,000
enter a time in the duration box next to the options tab.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,001
I'll enter one second.

28
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,002
If you want all slides in the presentation

29
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:19,004
to transition in the same way, select apply to all.

30
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,006
If you want to see the transition in action,

31
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:26,006
select the slideshow icon in the lower right corner.

32
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,001
To remove a transition,

33
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,006
select none in the transition gallery,

34
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,004
or select apply to all

35
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:37,000
if you want to get rid of all the transitions.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,007
If you want to remove only one transition,

37
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:43,000
remember that a transition applies to a slide's entrance,

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,007
not how it exits.

39
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,009
So if you want to remove the exit effects for a slide,

40
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,003
remove the transition from the slide after.

41
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:52,005
Animations are another way

42
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,007
to add interest to your presentation.

43
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:56,001
To add an animation,

44
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,004
select the object or text on the slide

45
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:00,006
that you want to animate.

46
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:05,005
Next, go to the animations tab in the top ribbon.

47
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:10,002
Open the animations gallery and select the one you want.

48
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,007
On the animations tab,

49
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,003
open the effect options list

50
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:17,001
and select from the available options.

51
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,005
Effect options are available for text

52
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:23,000
or for choosing the direction or intensity of an animation.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Not all animations have effect options.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,007
To preview the animation,

55
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,006
on the slideshow tab of the ribbon

56
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:32,003
select play from the beginning.

57
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,008
When in slideshow view,

58
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,006
navigate through the slides

59
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:39,009
to make an animation effect play.

60
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:41,008
To remove an animation effect,

61
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,005
select the animated object or text,

62
00:02:44,005 --> 00:02:47,007
then in the animations tab in the top ribbon

63
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:51,004
open the animations gallery and select none.

64
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,000
Adding motion to your presentation

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,009
through animation and transitions

66
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:57,009
is a great skill to make your presentations pop.

67
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:00,002
Try adding an animation and transition

68
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,007
to your next presentation.
