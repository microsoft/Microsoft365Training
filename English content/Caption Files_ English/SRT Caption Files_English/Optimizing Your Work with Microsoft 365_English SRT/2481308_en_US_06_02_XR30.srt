00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,007
- [Instructor] Need to send a mass communication?

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,007
Mail merges are particularly valuable

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:07,002
when you're sending an email to multiple people

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:09,008
with individualized messages.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,001
In this lesson,

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,009
I'm going to walk you through a step by step process

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,007
to send a mail merge using Word, Outlook,

8
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:19,005
and spreadsheets in Excel.

9
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,007
The process starts with the main document.

10
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:24,006
You'll add recipients, add fields to the document

11
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,006
so mail merge can individualize your email message,

12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,001
and then send.

13
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,001
Please note that the mail merge feature

14
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,009
is only available in the desktop version

15
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:39,005
and the step by step Mail Merge Wizard only appears on a PC.

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,009
You can follow along with the sample Word document

17
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,000
in your exercise files.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,009
It's called practice mail merge document.

19
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,009
In this example, I'm going to send a reminder email

20
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:53,001
to attendees for a customer event.

21
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:54,007
With the document open,

22
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,007
go to the mailings tab on the top ribbon of the screen

23
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:03,006
and select Start Mail Merge.

24
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,003
Then in the dropdown menu,

25
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:10,005
select Step by Step Mail Merge Wizard.

26
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:11,008
This takes you through the steps

27
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:15,002
of sending a mail merge one step at a time.

28
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:18,001
Next, select the type of document you're working on

29
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:23,001
and email,

30
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:28,007
then select Next: Starting Document.

31
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:31,007
In the next step, the wizard lets you start from a template

32
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,005
or an existing document.

33
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,005
Select Use the current document,

34
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,007
which is already open and ready.

35
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:42,001
Select Next: Select recipients.

36
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,000
You can use a list generated from Outlook, Excel,

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,004
or generate a new list write in Word.

38
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:51,007
For this example, I drafted a contact list in Excel,

39
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:54,009
follow along by downloading the list in the exercise file.

40
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:58,002
It's called email contact list example.

41
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:02,005
Select Use an existing list.

42
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,000
When you select this option,

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,005
you also need to select which contacts to use,

44
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,009
so select Browse.

45
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:18,004
Navigate to your contact list and select Open.

46
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,004
Confirm the table sheet to use,

47
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:23,007
select Okay,

48
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:26,000
verify that the list was imported correctly,

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,001
and select Okay again.

50
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:37,006
Then select Next: Write your email message.

51
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,004
Place your cursor where you want the information

52
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:40,007
to go in the message

53
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,005
and select the information type in the wizard panel.

54
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,003
For example, place your cursor

55
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:47,000
where you want the greeting line to go

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,006
and select Greeting Line.

57
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:54,006
In the insert greeting line window,

58
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,008
You can select the format of the greeting line

59
00:02:56,008 --> 00:03:00,009
such as salutation, name format, and more.

60
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:03,004
If the recipient's name in the list is missing,

61
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:06,000
Word replaces it with a generic greeting.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,002
I'll change this to, To whom it may concern.

63
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:15,006
In the preview box,

64
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:18,001
you can use the arrows to go through the contacts

65
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:27,006
to see how each greeting will appear.

66
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:31,006
When you're done, select Okay.

67
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:33,005
And Word inserts the merge field,

68
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:37,000
which appears as text between two arrows.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,001
Now you can add more merge fields

70
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:47,007
or move on and select Next: Preview your email messages.

71
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,004
Word temporarily replaces the merge field

72
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:52,004
with entries from the recipient list

73
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,009
so you can preview how each email will look

74
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,006
before it's sent.

75
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:58,002
This is especially helpful

76
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:01,009
if your email contains a lot of merge fields.

77
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:04,001
Once you've reviewed how each email will look,

78
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:08,007
select Next: Complete the mail merge.

79
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:11,005
You're almost ready to send out the mass email.

80
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:15,006
Select Electronic Mail.

81
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,009
Add a subject line.

82
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:26,008
I'll add Customer Appreciation Day.

83
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:32,002
And select Okay when you're ready to send them.

84
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:33,009
You're all set.

85
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,008
Once you have all the appropriate settings

86
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,000
and fields in place,

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,009
mail merge can help you communicate quickly

88
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,003
to large groups while still customizing each message.

89
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:43,002
Try it the next time

90
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:45,002
you have to send out mass communications.
