00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] With busy schedules,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,005
sometimes it's hard to find free time to meet

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,000
with a group of people.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,002
What if there was an easy way to find open meeting times

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,002
and invite attendees all in one step?

6
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,001
Outlook is a powerful tool you can use

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,006
to schedule meetings.

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,002
After this lesson, you'll be able to use Outlook

9
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:21,006
to schedule meetings and manage your attendees easily.

10
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:28,004
I'll start from the Microsoft 365 homepage and open Outlook.

11
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:35,000
From here I'll open the calendar I'll be scheduling from.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,008
In this example, I'll look for a common time to meet

13
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:40,007
with the speakers of an event that I'm organizing.

14
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:43,005
Before I jump into actually scheduling meetings,

15
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:46,002
I need to see where there are openings in their schedules.

16
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:49,005
The scheduling assistant is a tool that checks the calendars

17
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,005
of all potential event attendees for common openings

18
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,000
at the same time.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,005
In the menu bar select the new event button.

20
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,001
This opens the schedule a meeting page.

21
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,009
I'll select scheduling assistant

22
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,002
from the menu bar at the top.

23
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:05,004
I can add the date and time

24
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,005
that I would like to schedule my meeting.

25
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:08,007
I'm going to schedule my meeting

26
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:19,001
for March 11th from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM.

27
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,004
To add people to the meeting,

28
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:24,009
select add required attendee or optional attendee.

29
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:28,006
You can also add a meeting room from the same window.

30
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:37,009
I'm going to add my attendees.

31
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,003
This outlined bar represents the meeting time.

32
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,009
You can check the legend at the bottom

33
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,001
of the scheduling window to see what the colors

34
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,007
in the bars mean.

35
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,000
By default, you can only see free

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,003
or busy information in the bars.

37
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:53,004
You cannot see any other details

38
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,005
unless an attendee shares their calendar with you.

39
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:59,001
Just knowing if an attendee is free or busy

40
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:01,005
gives you enough information to try and find

41
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:02,004
a meeting time

42
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:05,003
that doesn't conflict with everyone's schedule.

43
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:07,002
If scheduling conflicts appear,

44
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,003
you can move the meeting time by changing

45
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,003
the start and end time up by the dates and times

46
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,007
near the top of the scheduling window.

47
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,009
After you find a time that works for everyone,

48
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,009
you can send an update.

49
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,009
Select done in the top left corner

50
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:27,000
of the scheduling assistant window.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,004
Add a title to your meeting and select send.

52
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,004
And now each attendee gets a meeting request

53
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:40,006
and the event appears on their calendars.

54
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:43,001
It can be quite a juggling act to find a meeting time

55
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,006
that works for everyone,

56
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:48,002
but the scheduling assistant makes the search much simpler.

57
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:50,007
Now you try, use the scheduling assistant

58
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,002
to schedule your next meeting.
