00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:05,009
is creating labels for mass communication.

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,002
It adds a nice touch of professionalism

00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:12,001
when mailings are addressed easily and properly.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,002
In this lesson, I'm going to show you ways to use Word

6
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,002

10
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:30,003
To get started, I'll open a blank Microsoft Word document

11
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:35,000
and select mailings from the top ribbon.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,003
Next, select start mail merge

13
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:42,006
and then the step by step mail merge wizard.

14
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:45,000
The mail merge wizard takes you through the process

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
of creating labels step by step.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,005

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,009

20
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:15,004
and product number for your physical labels and select OK.

21
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:18,002
To view the label grid, go to the Layout tab

22
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:27,000
on the top ribbon and select view grid lines.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,008
Then move on to the next step

24
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:34,005
by selecting next, select recipients.

25
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:38,004
Follow along by downloading the list in the exercise file,

26
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:42,009
it's called example contact list.

27
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:51,007
Select browse to find your recipient list Excel document,

28
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:54,006
then select Open.

29
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:58,002
In the next window, make sure the first row of data

30
00:01:58,002 --> 00:02:05,009
contains column headers box is selected and select OK.

31
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,009
This lets Word know that the first row

32
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,000
does not contain mailing information for your labels.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,003
Now you can check your list

34
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:21,003
and when you're sure everything is correct select OK.

35
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,005
Select next arrange your labels

36
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:28,007

37
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:30,007
Add the appropriate address information

38
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:36,002
by selecting address block and view how the addresses

39
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:39,004
will appear in the insert address block window.

40
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:40,008
You can preview each recipient

41
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:47,004
by going through the arrows at the top of the box.

42
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:50,003
If the data isn't going into the labels correctly,

43
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,006
try editing the match fields to make sure

44
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,000
the appropriate headings line up.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,005
For example, first name needs to align

46
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,001
with the first name heading and address one

47
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:24,001
with the billing address and so on and so forth.

48
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:34,009
Once you've confirmed everything is correct, select OK,

49
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:40,001

preview your labels.

51
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:45,004
Finally, you're ready to complete the mail merge

52
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:49,009
by selecting next, complete the mail merge.

53
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,009

54
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:57,000

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
