00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:02,003
- [Instructor] Adding data to your documents can make

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,003
or break its usefulness.

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,004
It can make your content more compelling

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,000
or just confuse your audience

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,006
if it's not displayed accurately.

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:15,002
Word makes sharing data in an organized manner an easy task.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:18,000
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to create

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,006
and edit tables to ensure every team member

9
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:23,008
can easily review the data you present.

10
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,004
To get started, I'll open my Word document

11
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:29,003
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

12
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:32,001
Follow along by downloading the sample Word document

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,002
in your Exercise Files.

14
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:43,003
It's called Customer Event Itinerary Example B.

15
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,005
In this example, I'll show you how to insert a table

16
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:50,001
for organizing an event schedule into a Word document.

17
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,006
Tables are useful to present

18
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:55,003
and organize detailed information, such as cost figures,

19
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:58,005
a guest list of names, or inventory.

20
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,006
To insert a basic table, start by placing your cursor

21
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:04,005
where you want the table to be in your document.

22
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:06,002
I'll start at the top of the document

23
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:10,008
underneath Itinerary for day of event details.

24
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:16,009
Next, select Insert from the top ribbon, then select Table.

25
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,000
And move the cursor over the grid until the number of cells

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,003
in the rows and columns you need is highlighted.

27
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:30,004
Selected, and the table will appear in your document.

28
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:38,005
Now, you can type directly into it.

29
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:42,001
To adjust it and apply formatting, hover over your table

30
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,002
and select the four way directional arrows

31
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:47,007
in the top left corner.

32
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,002
You can choose to change the font

33
00:01:49,002 --> 00:01:52,008
of all the texts in the table, apply any styles,

34
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:54,006
incorporate cell shading,

35
00:01:54,006 --> 00:02:03,003
and add or remove columns or rows.

36
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:05,005
More editing and formatting options

37
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:08,000
can be found by navigating to the top ribbon

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and selecting Table.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,009
To highlight and organize your data, select Table Styles.

40
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,008
You can also split cells, add borders,

41
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:25,009
or even change the colors of the cells and table itself.

42
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:29,002
This looks pretty good, but before I share this table,

43
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:31,003
I want to make sure that it is inclusive

44
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:34,003
and can be read out loud to people who use a screen reader

45
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:37,003
or have different abilities.

46
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,008
To check the accessibility of the table,

47
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:42,004
first, I'll navigate all the way through the table

48
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,007
using only the Tab key.

49
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,001
If you can tap through the table

50
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,004
cell by cell and row by row,

51
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:58,008
a screen reader should have no trouble with it.

52
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:01,004
You can also use the Accessibility Checker

53
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:02,004
to get suggestions

54
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:05,006
on how to make your document more accessible.

55
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:11,000
Navigate to the top ribbon and select Review.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,002
Then select Check Accessibility.

57
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:16,008
Word will open the Accessibility Checker on the right side

58
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:20,003
of the screen with a list of errors and warnings,

59
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:24,005
as well as a list of tips on how to fix each issue.

60
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:30,000
When you choose an item from the inspection results,

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,008
Word displays that part of the document.

62
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:36,006
Below the inspection results, Word explains why

63
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:39,008
and how to fix the issue you've selected.

64
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:42,002
After you make all the necessary changes,

65
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:45,009
your document will be more accessible to everyone.

66
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,000
I encourage you to add a table and check for accessibility

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
in the next document you create.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Your data will appear more organized

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and easier to understand.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,009
Way to go!
