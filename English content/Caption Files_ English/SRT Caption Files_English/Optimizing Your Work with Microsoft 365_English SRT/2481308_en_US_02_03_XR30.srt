1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,001
- [Instructor] It can be overwhelming

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,001
to be the only person taking notes during a meeting.

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:07,001
By keeping your OneNote notebook in a shared location,

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,003
you can let people collaborate during the meeting

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:12,004
and easily share notes after the meeting ends.

6
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,005
After this lesson, you'll be able to manage your notes

7
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,003
and distribute them to the right people

8
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:20,004
to keep your entire team up to date.

9
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,005
So first, I'll open OneNote

10
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:29,008
and open my notebook entitled Customer Event A.

11
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,000
In this example,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,007
I'll share my notes with others on my team working

13
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,001
on a customer event.

14
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,001
To invite others to edit my notebook,

15
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,006
navigate to the menu at the top left of the page

16
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:45,006
and select File, then select Share

17
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:48,009
then Share With People.

18
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,007
Next, I'll enter the names or emails

19
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,006
of the people I want to share the notebook with.

20
00:00:54,006 --> 00:01:04,009
I'll share it with Joni and Isaiah.

21
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:11,006
Then select Send.

22
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,003
If you need to stop sharing a notebook with someone,

23
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:16,002
navigate back to Share With People

24
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:18,008
and select the person's name or icon

25
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:23,002
at the bottom of the Send Link window.

26
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:25,005
A manage access window pops up.

27
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,001
You can select Stop Sharing

28
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:32,003
so that they no longer have access to the notebook.

29
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,002
Click the X in the top right corner

30
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:38,001
of the Manage Access window to close it.

31
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,000
I can also share a notebook with a link.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,009
I want anyone who receives the shared link

33
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,008
to be able to access the content,

34
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,003
so I'll navigate to the menu at the top left of the page

35
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:53,009
and select File, then Share, and Share With People.

36
00:01:53,009 --> 00:02:00,008
In the link settings, select Anyone With Link,

37
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:04,005
then select Apply,

38
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:09,008
and a link to share the notebook is generated.

39
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,000
The recipients won't need a Microsoft account

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,005
and can access the content

41
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:16,005
without having to enter a passcode or sign in.

42
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,009
Keep in mind that the link can be forwarded,

43
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,009
and anyone who receives the link

44
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,004
will be able to access the notebook.

45
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,000
To restrict access

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,005
select the Share icon on the top right side,

47
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:35,002
then Manage Access.

48
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,005
When the Manage Access window appears,

49
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:41,002
select the three dots next to Copy.

50
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,003
You can change the sharing permissions

51
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:49,006
so there is an expiration date to access.

52
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:51,006
If you want to secure the content

53
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:53,001
and get a link that only works

54
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,006
for the people you invite,

55
00:02:54,006 --> 00:03:00,009
navigate back to Share With People.

56
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:05,007
Select anyone with the link can edit.

57
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:10,002
And in Link Settings, select specific people.

58
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:11,008
Enter the names or emails

59
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:22,007
of the people you want to share with, then select Apply.

60
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:26,001
The recipients will then need to verify their identity

61
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:29,002
before they can view the content.

62
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,001
Sharing and collaborating on notes

63
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,000
is a great way to keep everyone plugged

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,005
into important things during and after a meeting.

65
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,004
Try collaborating with people in OneNote

66
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,008
for your next meeting.
