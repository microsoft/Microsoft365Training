00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] Whether you're working on a project

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,006
or communicating with a new team,

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,009
information and contacts can quickly become disorganized

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,007
if you don't manage them.

5
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,006
The good news is there is an easy way

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,004
to automate your organization,

7
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,008
keeping all related information together.

8
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:18,004
In this lesson, I'm going to share techniques

9
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:22,000
so that you can optimize and maintain your Outlook inbox

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,005
more effectively.

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:27,006
First, I want to show you how to create folders.

12
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,006
Folders bring structure to your inbox

13
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:33,001
and allow relevant information to be stored together.

14
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,007
You can use folders to organize

15
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:39,009
your emails, calendars, tasks, and reorganize messages.

16
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:43,009
So first I'll start on the Microsoft 365 homepage.

17
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm going to open my Outlook.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,004
Here I am in my inbox.

19
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,008
In this example, I'm going to adjust my Outlook inbox

20
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,009
by using folders to keep information

21
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:58,001
about an upcoming event organized.

22
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,008
To create a folder in Outlook

23
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:02,004
on the left side, under the Folders drop-down,

24
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,001
select New folder.

25
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,007
Enter a name for the new folder

26
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:09,006
that makes sense for what you'll be using it for.

27
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:14,009
I'll call this folder Upcoming Event.

28
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,007
So now I've created an easily accessible place

29
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:21,002
where I can organize any messages related to this event.

30
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:23,001
To move messages to a folder,

31
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,004
select and drag the emails into the folder.

32
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,001
To move more than one email,

33
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:31,006
select the circle on the top left corner of the email.

34
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:33,004
When you make these selections,

35
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,005
an option menu on the right appears.

36
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:38,008
Select the Move drop-down menu,

37
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:43,003
and select the folder that you want to move the emails to.

38
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,005
Talk about efficiency.

39
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,005
Next, I want to show you how to use contact lists

40
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,003
to keep you organized.

41
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:53,003
A contact list is a collection of email addresses

42
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:56,006
you can use to send emails to a group of people.

43
00:01:56,006 --> 00:01:58,005
To create a contact list,

44
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:00,003
I'll navigate to the People page,

45
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:04,003
using the toolbar on the left side.

46
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:09,000
Then select your contact lists under the Contacts drop-down.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,002
Next, select the plus next to Create a contact list.

48
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:17,008
Contact lists are created in the default contacts folder,

49
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,007
and under All Contact lists.

50
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:23,009
If you want to save the contact list in a different folder,

51
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:28,002
select the folder before you select New contact list.

52
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,003
Enter name for the list.

53
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll call this one, Customer Event Attendees.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,008
And then add your contacts, information,

55
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,005
names, email addresses,

56
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:41,000
and any other important information.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,007
One row at a time pressing Enter after each entry.

58
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:49,007
Then I'll select Create.

59
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:52,007
To adjust which people are included in your contact list,

60
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:59,009
navigate to the People page and select contact lists.

61
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:03,003
To adjust which people are included in your contact list,

62
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:06,009
select Edit.

63
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,003
From here you can either enter more names

64
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:11,001
or email addresses to add people

65
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:13,009
or remove people by selecting the X,

66
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:16,003
next to their name or email address.

67
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:19,005
Once you've made your edits, select Save.

68
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:21,009
Now that a contact list is created,

69
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:24,001
you can send emails to the full group

70
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:27,005
without having to type each name individually.

71
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,006
Creating folders helps you organize your inbox,

72
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:33,003
but you can keep your inbox even more organized

73
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:35,004
by setting up rules.

74
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:36,009
Rules allow you to move

75
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,007
and respond to email messages automatically.

76
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:42,002
For example,

77
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:45,000
if I wanted to move a message from one of my colleagues

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,001
into the Upcoming Events folder,

79
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:49,005
I can just right-click on one of those messages,

80
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:53,005
select Advanced actions, then Create rule.

81
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll select More options and a condition.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,009
In this case for all messages from Lynne Robbins,

83
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:06,001
I will select the drop-down for Select an action,

84
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:08,009
and choose Move to.

85
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:10,009
In the Select a folder drop-down,

86
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,007
select the folder I created for my event.

87
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:18,005
To use the rule right away, select the Run rule now box.

88
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:23,002
Then select Save.

89
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:27,001
The message from my colleague now appears in that folder.

90
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,003
By using these tools and putting rules in place,

91
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,002
you can organize

92
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:34,000
all your messages and contacts in your inbox

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,008
quickly and efficiently.

94
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,007
Try setting up some rules and lists,

95
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:41,006
and see how well you can streamline your email workflow.
