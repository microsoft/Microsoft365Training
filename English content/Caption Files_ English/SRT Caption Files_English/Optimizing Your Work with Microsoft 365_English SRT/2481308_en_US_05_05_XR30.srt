1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Educator] The meeting was scheduled,

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,001
the attendees have arrived,

3
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:05,004
and now it's time to present.

4
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,003
In this lesson,

5
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,002
I'll show you how to present in Teams

6
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:12,008
directly from PowerPoint by sharing your screen or windows

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:16,006
and by requesting and taking control from another presenter.

8
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:17,005
In this example,

9
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,002
I want to share a presentation

10
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:24,004
on the progress my team is making on a key customer event.

11
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,006
First, I'll join a Teams meeting

12
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:27,009
to show you how to present

13
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:38,007
using the Present in Teams feature.

14
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:43,007
From here, I'll open my presentation in PowerPoint.

15
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:49,006
Select Present in the top right corner of PowerPoint.

16
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:59,002
And in the dropdown menu, select Present in Teams.

17
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:01,006
Your presentation will appear in Microsoft Teams

18
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:04,005
for you and all your attendees.

19
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,005
When you're done presenting,

20
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:15,005
select Stop Presenting at the top of the Teams' screen.

21
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,006
Next, I'll show you how to share your screen

22
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:19,006
in a Teams meeting.

23
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:22,003
In my Teams meeting, I'll select the Share Content icon

24
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,003
at the top right of the screen

25
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:29,002
and then choose what I want to share.

26
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:33,002
Screen lets you show everything on your screen.

27
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,002
PowerPoint Live lets you share

28
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:37,009
recently opened PowerPoint presentations.

29
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,003
Window lets you share an open window,

30
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:45,004
like a specific app or document that you have open.

31
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:52,009
I'll share a window and select my open Excel document.

32
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:55,000
After you select what you want to share,

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
a red border surrounds what you are sharing.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,007
To stop sharing, select the stop sharing icon

35
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:04,007
indicated by an X in the minimized Teams video

36
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:08,007
in the lower right corner of your screen

37
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:17,004
or at the top of the screen where it says Stop Presenting.

38
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,003
Sometimes during a meeting

39
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:21,001
you'll need another participant to share,

40
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,001
Teams lets you give control to other participants.

41
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,006
When you give control to another participant,

42
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:29,000
you will both be in control of sharing,

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,003
but you can take back control anytime.

44
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll share my Excel document again.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,004
To let someone else control

46
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,007
while you're sharing your screen,

47
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:45,006
go to the sharing toolbar at the top,

48
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:49,002
and select Give Control.

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:55,005
Select the name of the attendee you want to give control to.

50
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:58,001
And Teams sends a notification to that participant

51
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:01,002
to let them know you're sharing control.

52
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,004
Note, only users logged into Teams

53
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:07,005
will be able to both request and give control.

54
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,007
While you're sharing control,

55
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:11,008
they can make selections, edits, and other modifications

56
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:14,003
to the shared screen.

57
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:19,008
To take back control, select Cancel Control at the top.

58
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,008
If a participant wants to take control

59
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,003
while another person is sharing,

60
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:27,000
they'll select Request Control at the top of the window.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,003
The person sharing can then approve or deny your request.

62
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,003
While they have control,

63
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,004
they can make selections, edits,

64
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:41,001
and other modifications to the shared screen.

65
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,002
When you're done, select Cancel Control

66
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:47,004
to stop sharing control.

67
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:53,005
That's teamwork making the dream work.

68
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,002
Using Presenter mode can help you become a more engaging

69
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,004
and integral part of your presentation

70
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:04,001
instead of sharing screen or window content only.

71
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,007
In the upper right corner of Teams,

72
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,009
select Share Content to see Presenter modes

73
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,000
and other options.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,002
Under Presenter mode, choose the mode that you want.

75
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:17,000
Stand out,

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,007
where your live image is in front of the presentation,

77
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,005
side by side, where your live image is framed

78
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:26,000
next to the presentation,

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,008
or reporter, where your live image is over a background

80
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:33,001
and the shared content is over your shoulder.

81
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:34,000
In Reporter mode,

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,003
your image appears bigger than the shared content.

83
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:40,001
If you're ready to start your presentation,

84
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:41,009
make sure your camera is on,

85
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,004
select the presentation mode,

86
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:47,008
and choose a screen or window on your device when prompted.

87
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,006
There are lots of options

88
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:50,003
for you to deliver engaging content

89
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:53,009
in your presentations and meetings with Teams,

90
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,000
try using some of these features in your next large meeting.
