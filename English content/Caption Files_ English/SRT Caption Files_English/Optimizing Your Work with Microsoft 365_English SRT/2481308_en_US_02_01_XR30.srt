00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,006
- [Instructor] Have you ever taken detailed notes only

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,004
to have to sift through them later in order

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,008
to find that one thing you jotted down halfway through?

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,002
What a pain.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:10,008
In this lesson, I'm going

6
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:12,006
to share how you can use OneNote

7
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:15,005
to help organize your notes.

8
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:22,001
I'll start on the Microsoft 365 homepage.

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,005
Select OneNote on the left side of the menu.

10
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:28,007
In this example, I'll create a notebook for an event

11
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:34,005
that I'm organizing by selecting New notebook.

12
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,000
Name your notebook.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,005
I'll name mine Customer Event, then select Create.

14
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,002
Each OneNote notebook contains sections,

15
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,006
and each section contains pages,

16
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:54,007
as you can see underneath the menu on the left side.

17
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:58,009
To add content to a notebook, you need to add structure.

18
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:02,000
First, with sections and then pages,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then subpages within those sections.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,008
Since there are a lot of meetings happening for this event,

21
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:11,001
I'll create a section by pressing Enter

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:20,000
on this empty notebook page and call the section Agenda.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,005
Inside this new section,

24
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:24,000
a blank page is automatically created.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,001
To keep each page of notes organized,

26
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:31,007
I'll title this page Breakout Sessions,

27
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,001
and now the page Breakout Sessions,

28
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:38,004
inside the section Agenda, in the notebook Customer Event,

29
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:42,001
I can finally start jotting down my thoughts.

30
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,005
To add more pages to each section,

31
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:47,004
navigate to the bottom and select Add page

32
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:51,002
and give it a title.

33
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:58,008
I'll add two more pages, Group A

34
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:03,008
and Group B.

35
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,007
To add more sections to the notebook,

36
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:13,000
select Add section at the bottom and give it a title.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,006
I'll add one more section and call it Planning.

38
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,002
To rename a page or section, select it,

39
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:28,004
then right-click it and choose Rename,

40
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:29,009
then enter the new name.

41
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:34,001
I'll rename this Logistics.

42
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:36,004
To add even more structure to your notes,

43
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,000
you can turn your pages into subpages.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,008
For example, you can make Group A and Group B subpages

45
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:47,003
of the whole Breakout Sessions page.

46
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:50,004
To change a page to a subpage, right-click it

47
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,004
and select Make Subpage.

48
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:57,007
You'll see the title indent right under your main page,

49
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:00,008
showing that it is now a subpage.

50
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:03,007
To change the subpage back into a regular page,

51
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:08,003
right-click on it and select Promote Subpage.

52
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:11,005
Outside of the structural hierarchy, OneNote makes it easy

53
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:15,000
to find what you're looking for with tags and search.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tags can be used to categorize

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,004
and prioritize notes in your workbook.

56
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:23,003
With tags, you can quickly return to notes,

57
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:25,005
remind yourself about action items

58
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,007
or simply mark what's important.

59
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:32,000
To apply a tag, navigate to the page you want to work on,

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,004
then place your cursor at the beginning

61
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:38,004
of the line of text that you want to tag.

62
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:42,007
Next, go to Home in the top ribbon and select Tags.

63
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:45,003
Choose the tag you want to apply, select it,

64
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:48,005
and it appears next to the text.

65
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:55,002
To remove a tag, right-click it and select Remove Tag.

66
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:57,009
To search your notebook, go to the menu on the left

67
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,008
and select the magnifying glass icon.

68
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:04,009
In the search box, enter a keyword or phrase.

69
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:08,000
As you're typing, OneNote begins returning results

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,002
that match your search.

71
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:16,005
Choose a result to retrieve that matching note.

72
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,002
When you're done with the search,

73
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:22,009
press the Escape key on your keyboard.

74
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,008
Now that you've organized your notes,

75
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:27,002
it's important to know where they're saved.

76
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:29,008
Notes are automatically and continually saved

77
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:32,008
in the cloud, your OneDrive.

78
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,004
OneNote is a helpful tool

79
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:36,009
for capturing and organizing notes.

80
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,003
Try using tags and subpages

81
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,007
in OneNote in your meetings this week

82
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:44,007
and use the tools to keep your notes organized.
