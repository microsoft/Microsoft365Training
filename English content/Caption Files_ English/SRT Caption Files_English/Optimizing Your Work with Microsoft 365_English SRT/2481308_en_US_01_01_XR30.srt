- [Instructor] Between new conversations, documents,

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,006
and messages, if you leave your inbox unorganized,

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:09,002
all the emails you receive can be difficult to sort through.

4
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,007
In this lesson I'm going to show you a few best practices

5
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:15,006
for organizing your email inbox in Outlook

6
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,006
so you can keep track

7
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:19,006
of the flow of information as it comes in.

8
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:22,005
One of the best ways to keep emails top of mind

9
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,003
is to add flags.

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:28,003
Flags are an easy way to label the importance of an email

11
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,006
that you aren't going to take immediate action on.

12
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,007
In this example, I'll flag the emails that are related

13
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,002
to the event that I'm managing.

14
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,002
So first I'm going to start

15
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:43,009
from the Microsoft 365 homepage and open Outlook.

16
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,001
Here I'm in my inbox.

17
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,008
There are new unread messages

18
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:51,002
as well as messages that I've already read.

19
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:52,003
To set a flag,

20
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,009
hover your cursor over the email message,

21
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,009
then select the flag icon in the top right corner

22
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,008
of the message.

23
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:01,003
The flag changes to red.

24
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,007
And when the email message is opened,

25
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:07,006
a followup message appears in the header of the email.

26
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:11,007
To remove the flag, select the flag icon.

27
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,005
The follow up flag changes to a check mark.

28
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:16,000
When the email is open,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
in the top header it states the date the flag was complete.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,002
Another way to keep emails organized

31
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,005
is to use color categories.

32
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:27,002
Color categories allow you to identify

33
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,007
and group associated items in Outlook

34
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,006
so you can quickly track and organize them.

35
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:36,003
Before using a color category you first need to create one.

36
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:39,007
Select the email you wish to add to a category,

37
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,005
navigate to the ribbon,

38
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:46,005
identify the categorize icon, select the dropdown menu,

39
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,008
and then new category.

40
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,009
Add a name for the category and select a color,

41
00:01:52,009 --> 00:02:00,008
I'll name mine customer event.

42
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,000
Then select save.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,004
This color category is now ready to use.

44
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:10,007
Next I'll right click a message from the message list,

45
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:15,005
select categorize, and select the category I just created

46
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:18,007
from the list.

47
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:21,007
You can even assign a color category from the reading pane

48
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,000
or an open message.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,003
The next inbox organizing tool I recommend using

50
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:29,000
is auto reply.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,007
Auto reply allows you to respond to emails

52
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:34,009
when you're out of office or unavailable.

53
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:40,006
To set up auto reply select the settings icon,

54
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:45,005
then view all Outlook settings.

55
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:51,005
And then automatic replies.

56
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,008
Turn on the automatic replies toggle

57
00:02:53,008 --> 00:03:00,001
and then you can type your message in the message box.

58
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,001
Type in your out of office message.

59
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:05,001
I like to use something like, thank you for your email.

60
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,006
I am out of the office.

61
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:09,008
I will respond when I return.

62
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:12,000
If you don't want your out of office message

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,001
sent all the time, select send replies during a time period.

64
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,002
Then choose the dates and times

65
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:32,005
you'd like to set your automatic reply for.

66
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,005
You can also select

67
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,004
if you want Outlook to block your calendar

68
00:03:35,004 --> 00:03:38,003
for that time period, decline new invites,

69
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:41,009
or cancel any meetings you might have during this period.

70
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:44,003
You can format the text using the toolbar

71
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:47,001
or cut and paste text you've already formatted,

72
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:50,000
including hyperlinked text.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,009
When you're finished

74
00:03:50,009 --> 00:03:55,008
with the message and settings, select save.

75
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,001
Now Outlook is programmed to send the automated reply

76
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:02,005
as a response to messages during your selected times.

77
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:05,003
Sorting and organizing your email are key skills

78
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:08,005
for keeping important communications and information

79
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,003
easy to find.

80
00:04:10,003 --> 00:04:12,009
An organized inbox will keep you focused

81
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:17,000
and allow you to spend your time on more important tasks.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,009
Try using these tools to bring order

83
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:22,002
to your inbox this week and see how much time you can save.
