00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,006
- [Educator] Referring to specific resources in a document

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,003
can take up a lot of space.

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,005
With footnotes, you can keep your references organized

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:09,004
and easy to read.

5
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:10,006
In this lesson,

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:13,002
I'm going to show you how to reference your content in Word

7
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:16,004
with footnotes and adding a table of contents.

8
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,000
Footnotes are used to explain, comment on,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,005
or provide references to something in a document.

10
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:25,005
A table of contents helps you to locate specific information

11
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,005
in a document.

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,005
To get started,

13
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll open Word from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,002
You can follow along with the sample Word document

15
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,000
in your exercise files,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,003
it's called Customer Event Product Document.

17
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,008
In this example, I'll be editing a product document

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,007
from a customer event I'm organizing.

19
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,008
First, I'll add footnotes.

20
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:51,006
Footnotes are citations that appear at the footer

21
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,003
or the bottom of the page.

22
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:54,006
Once a footnote has been added,

23
00:00:54,006 --> 00:00:58,003
you'll have a small superscript number after the cited text

24
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:01,007
and the full citation on the page's footer.

25
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,007
To insert a footnote,

26
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,001
I'll place my cursor

27
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,002
to the right of the text I want to cite.

28
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:10,006
From here, I'll navigate to the top ribbon,

29
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:14,006
select References, and then Insert Footnote.

30
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,006
At this point, a window appears where I can specify

31
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:20,000
the details of the original work I'm citing.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll enter St. Clair Housen "To Be A Mogul"

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,002
Chapter 3, Page 46, Line 22.

34
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,009
This is the first footnote I'm adding to the document.

35
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:33,002
So the number one is in the box.

36
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:34,009
Press the Escape button on your keyboard,

37
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,009
or select the body of the document

38
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:39,005
to save and close the footnote.

39
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,005
When I'm in editing view,

40
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:44,003
I can't see the citation at the bottom of the page,

41
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,009
but the footnote will be there.

42
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:52,008
If I select the number, I can edit the footnote details.

43
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:55,002
To see how the footnote appears in your document,

44
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:57,003
I need to be in reading view.

45
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,007
Navigate to the top ribbon, select View,

46
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:03,006
then select Reading View.

47
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:06,007
Now, when I scroll through the document,

48
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:12,003
I can see that the footnotes are at the bottom of the page.

49
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:17,005
Now, I'll select the Edit Document tab in the top ribbon

50
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:22,001
and then choose Edit.

51
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,002
Word will send you back to editing view

52
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,008
where you can continue editing.

53
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:29,007
If a footnote is not the citation method you want to use,

54
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,001
consider an end note,

55
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,007
which adds the footer text to the end of the document

56
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:36,005
instead of the bottom of the page.

57
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,007
Navigate to the top ribbon, select References,

58
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:42,004
and then Insert End Note.

59
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,004
Another way to keep your document organized

60
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:48,007
is to add a table of contents.

61
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:50,007
Before you create a table of contents,

62
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,005
you need to select your texts and apply a heading.

63
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:56,003
Word uses the headings in your document

64
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,007
to build an automatic table of contents

65
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:02,007
that can be updated when you change the heading text,

66
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,007
sequence, or level.

67
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:09,001
Highlight the text you wish to apply a heading to,

68
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:13,001
then navigate to the Home tab,

69
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,007
and in the style galleries, select the heading choice

70
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:18,009
and the text automatically takes that heading form.

71
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,002
If you have subheadings,

72
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:22,005
select different texts that you would like to have

73
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:37,007
under the first heading and apply a different style to it.

74
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:41,002
Now you're ready to create and add your table of contents.

75
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,006
Now place your cursor

76
00:03:42,006 --> 00:03:44,008
where you want to insert the table of contents.

77
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,006
I usually place it near the beginning of the document

78
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:51,003
or after a title page.

79
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:56,007
On the top ribbon, select References.

80
00:03:56,007 --> 00:04:01,002
Next, select Table of Contents.

81
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:06,004
In the dropdown menu, choose Insert Table of Contents.

82
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,004
If you make changes to your document

83
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:10,000
that affect the table of contents,

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,006
you can update it by selecting the table

85
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,008
and selecting the update box that appears

86
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:17,005
to the left of the table of contents.

87
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,004
Adding references as footnotes

88
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:20,008
and creating a table of contents

89
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:23,003
is a great way of elevating your documents.

90
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:27,001
Try adding these reference forms to your next document.
