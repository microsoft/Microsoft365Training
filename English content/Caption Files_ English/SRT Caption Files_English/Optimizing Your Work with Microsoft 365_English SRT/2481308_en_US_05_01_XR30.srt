00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:02,005
- [Narrator] It can be frustrating when you're in a meeting

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:05,004
and don't have access to the information you need.

3
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,003
Microsoft Teams allows you to apply settings

4
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:12,000
so you can have a fluid, productive meeting every time.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,006
In this lesson, I'll show you

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:16,005
how to manage a team's settings and permissions.

7
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,003
To get started, I'll open Teams

8
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:25,001
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

9
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,006
Being the owner of the Customer Event team,

10
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,001
I will use this example.

11
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,008
To set general settings, select your profile picture

12
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:36,006
at the top of the app.

13
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:42,004
Select Manage account and the Settings window will appear

14
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,004
where you can change app settings,

15
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:52,001
notifications, or language.

16
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,005
Close the Settings window to save any changes.

17
00:00:56,005 --> 00:01:00,007
Next let's look at the settings related to a specific team.

18
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,000
In this example, I own a team

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,004
related to a customer event I'm planning,

20
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,002
so I can find the team's name and select the three dots

21
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:13,002
for more options, then Manage team.

22
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:16,006
In the Settings tab,

23
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:19,002
I can select or clear the options or permissions

24
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,001
that I want to use.

25
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,006
To change the team name, description, or privacy settings,

26
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,002
I'll go to the team's name

27
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,000
and select the three dots for more options,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,004
then Edit team.

29
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,004
I'll write a description for this team.

30
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,008
I'll write, "This is for the communication

31
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:44,006
about our upcoming customer event."

32
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:50,007
When I'm finished, I'll select Done.

33
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,005
If you're not a team owner,

34
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:55,006
you are either a member or a guest.

35
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:57,009
Members are the people in the team.

36
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:00,003
They talk with other team members in conversation

37
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:03,008
and can view, upload and change files.

38
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:07,001
Guests are people from outside of your organization

39
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,007
that a team owner invites,

40
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,007
such as partners or consultants

41
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:13,005
who will have limited access.

42
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:15,002
Guests have fewer capabilities

43
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,005
than team members or team owners,

44
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:22,003
but they can still participate in chat and create channels.

45
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,003
That's all there is to it.

46
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,005
Double check your team settings this week

47
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:28,005
to make sure that everyone you work with

48
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,006
has the correct access.

49
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe now is a good time to change your profile picture

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,004
to a great new selfie.
