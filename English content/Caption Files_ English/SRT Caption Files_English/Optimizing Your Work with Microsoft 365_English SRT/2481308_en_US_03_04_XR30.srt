00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] Sometimes the best way to share information

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,009
in a presentation is through data.

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,000
In this lesson, I'll show you how to add Excel charts,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,008
create and format tables,

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,006
and add flow charts to your presentations.

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:15,003
First, I'll show you how to add an Excel chart

7
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,002
to a PowerPoint presentation.

8
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,002
A chart is a tool that you can use

9
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,009
to communicate data graphically.

10
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,007
To start, I'll open Excel.

11
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,001
Follow along by downloading

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,006
the sample worksheet exercise file.

13
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:32,006
It's called Example PowerPoint Data.

14
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,002
So here in my Excel worksheet,

15
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,001
I have a nicely formatted chart.

16
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,006
I want to use it as is in my presentation,

17
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:42,000
so I'll take the chart and insert it into my presentation.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,006
I'll right click this chart and select copy.

19
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:48,008
Next, I'll open the presentation in PowerPoint.

20
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:50,001
Follow along by downloading

21
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:52,005
the sample PowerPoint exercise file.

22
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:56,009
It's called Customer Event Example (A).

23
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:58,005
I will then right click the slide where

24
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,007
I want to display the chart and select paste.

25
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,000
I can then resize the chart to fit appropriately

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,008
in the slide.

27
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:12,008
You can also do this with a table you formatted in Excel.

28
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:16,000
Now you might not always have data in Excel ready to go.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,003
So next I want to show you how to add and format a table

30
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:21,002
right in PowerPoint.

31
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:22,006
A table is used to manage

32
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:25,002
and analyze a group of related data.

33
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,003
To start, I'll select the slide where I want to add a table.

34
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:32,002
I'll go to the top ribbon and select insert.

35
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,001
Then table.

36
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,005
In the dropdown grid,

37
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,002
I'll use the cursor to select the number

38
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:40,005
of rows and columns that I need.

39
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,007
And an empty table is added to the slide.

40
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:46,002
From here I can add text to the table

41
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:55,007
by selecting a cell and typing directly in it.

42
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:57,001
I can also change the formatting

43
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,004
of the table by right clicking on it

44
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:06,002
and choosing from the editing options in the menu.

45
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,002
If a table doesn't illustrate your data,

46
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,005
perhaps a flow chart is a better visual to include

47
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,001
in your presentation.

48
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:16,009
A flow chart is a diagram that shows a process or workflow.

49
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:26,003
To start, I'll add a blank slide.

50
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:30,000
From here I'll go to the insert tab in the top ribbon,

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,009
then select smart art.

52
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,005
From the dropdown menu

53
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:38,009
in the process section, I'll select a process flow chart.

54
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:43,008
I like this one, basic chevron process.

55
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:46,001
After the flow chart is added to the slide,

56
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:50,000
a text editor box appears to the left of the chart.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll type the text for my chart in the text editor box

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:07,008
and watch the text appear in the chart graphic.

59
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,001
No matter what type of chart or table you add,

60
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,000
displaying your data in an easy to read way makes

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,001
for a compelling and consistent presentation.

62
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,007
How about adding a table or chart

63
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:20,005
to your next presentation to share your data?

64
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:22,008
I'm sure you'll get a positive response.
