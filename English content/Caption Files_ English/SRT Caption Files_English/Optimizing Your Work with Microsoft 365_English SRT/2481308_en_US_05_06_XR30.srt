1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,001
- Large meetings can often be noisy

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,006
and even chaotic.

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:04,008
Creating a breakout room

4
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,002
within a meeting is a great way to create space

5
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:10,000
for focus work with smaller groups.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,002
In this lesson,

7
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,003
I'll show you how to create

8
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:15,006
and manage breakout rooms in your Teams meetings.

9
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,008
In this example,

10
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,007
I'll create and manage breakout rooms

11
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:22,000
for a customer event my team is managing.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Please note that the breakout rooms can only be managed

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,009
from the Teams desktop app.

14
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:29,000
To get started,

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,007
I'll go to my Teams calendar and join a Teams meeting

16
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:40,005
that I have created from the meeting invitation.

17
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:46,005
Next I'll select the breakout rooms icon on the top menu.

18
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:50,001
Then I'll choose the number of rooms I want to create.

19
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:52,008
I can create up to 50 rooms per meeting.

20
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,009
Two is enough for this meeting.

21
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:56,000
From here,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,002
I need to assign attendees to rooms by adding participants.

23
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,001
I can have Teams evenly assign people

24
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,009
to rooms automatically,

25
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:08,007
or I can assign people to rooms myself manually.

26
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,002
I'll select automatically

27
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,005
and Teams will add attendees to rooms

28
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,006
as they join the meeting.

29
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:19,008
Then select Create rooms.

30
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,009
The rooms are created but not open.

31
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:24,006
With the breakout room set up,

32
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:25,009
let's keep them organized

33
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,005
and well managed by appointing breakout room managers,

34
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,001
naming the breakout rooms,

35
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,006
setting a time limit for breakout room sessions

36
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,006
and closing them.

37
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,007
To appoint a breakout room manager,

38
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:42,006
select room settings.

39
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:48,008
And switch the Assign presenters to manage rooms toggle on.

40
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:53,003
Next select Search for presenters,

41
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:58,008
and choose who you want to be breakout room managers.

42
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:00,008
To keep your meetings on schedule,

43
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:01,009
you can use time limits

44
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,002
that automatically close breakout rooms

45
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:06,006
after the required length.

46
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:11,000
Turn the Set a time limit toggle on

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,009
and choose a session length.

48
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,004
Once you've finished,

49
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:21,004
select the back button next to the Settings heading

50
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:25,005
to save your changes.

51
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:28,000
If you have multiple breakout rooms at once,

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,008
you can keep them organized by renaming them.

53
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:33,000
To rename a breakout room,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,009
select more options next

55
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:39,005
to the breakout room that you would like to rename.

56
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:45,006
When the dropdown menu appears, select Rename.

57
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:50,007
I'll name this room Group A

58
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:56,009
then select Rename.

59
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:06,004
And this second one, Group B.

60
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:08,005
Make sure to open the breakout rooms

61
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:15,006
after the attendees have been added.

62
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:18,001
At the end of small group time in your meeting,

63
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:20,008
you can close out the breakout rooms.

64
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:23,001
To close rooms individually,

65
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:27,004
select more options.

66
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,000
If you want to close all rooms

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
at the same time, select close.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,009
You will know the rooms have been successfully closed

69
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,009
when their status changes to closed.

70
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,006
Breakout rooms are great for creating spaces

71
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:49,002
within existing meetings to give small groups time to meet

72
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:51,005
before rejoining the larger group.

73
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:53,001
See where you can add breakout rooms

74
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,005
in your upcoming meetings.
