- [Narrator] Working with outside organizations

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,006
is a part of collaboration

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:06,007
and it's important to make any partnership experience

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,008
as seamless as possible.

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:12,000
In Teams, guests can participate in meetings,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,003
chats, and work on documents.

7
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:17,007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to invite external guests

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,008
and manage the settings and permissions

9
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,005
needed to work with them in Teams.

10
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,007
To get started, I'll open Teams

11
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:30,000
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,001
First, I'll select the team I want to add guests to.

13
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,003
In that team, I'll select more options

14
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,009
to the right of the name of that team.

15
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:41,004
And then I'll select Add member.

16
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:48,009
Here, I'll enter my guest email addresses.

17
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,009
When I'm done selecting all the guests,

18
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:57,004
select Add and the guests will be sent an email invitation.

19
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,006
A guest will have the label Guest attached to their name

20
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:05,005
wherever it's displayed in Microsoft Teams.

21
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:07,004
You can also check the top of any channel

22
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,000
to see how many guests are in it

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,004
by selecting the information icon in the top right.

24
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:19,002
To close it, select the information icon again.

25
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,004
To set specific guest access,

26
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:26,001
select next to the team name for more options.

27
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:30,007
From there, select Manage team.

28
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:37,003
In the Settings tab, select the Guest permissions dropdown

29
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:40,004
to select or clear options or permissions

30
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:42,001
that you want to use.

31
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,007
Well done.

32
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,006
Now you're ready to add external guests

33
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:47,008
and set specific permissions for them.

34
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,008
You'll be collaborating in no time.
