- [Instructor] Have you ever needed more than just words

00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,003
to capture ideas correctly?

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,004
Having images or videos can be helpful

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,003
to reference along with notes.

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:10,006
In this lesson,

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,003
I'll show you how to insert media

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,000
and tables into OneNote

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,006
to create an interactive notebook in OneNote.

9
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,003
So first, I'll open OneNote

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:25,002
to an existing notebook of mine, customer event.

11
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:26,007
To add a picture,

12
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:31,004
place the cursor where you want to add it.

13
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:34,000
Select Insert from the top ribbon, then Picture,

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,005
and select From Online.

00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:39,008
In the search bar,

16
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,003
type the name of an image you are looking for

17
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:48,004
and press Enter.

18
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:51,000
Use the scroll bar on the right side of the window

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,002
and select the picture that works best for you.

20
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:01,008
Select Insert when finished.

21
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:03,009
The picture will add and appear in your notes

22
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:08,007
where you placed it.

23
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,008
Let's say you want to reference another file

24
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,000
in your notes.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,006
To attach a copy of a file to your notebook,

26
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:21,004
you'll place the cursor where you want to link the file.

27
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:26,007

into your notes.

32
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,008
Find the video you want online,

33
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,007

34
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:51,001
and then select where you want it on the page

35
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:56,007
and paste it.

36
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,008
You can select the link to play the video back

37
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:00,005
on the original website,

38
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:03,003
or select the Play button on the embedded video

39
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,005
and watch it right in your notes.

40
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,004
When data needs to be stored and shared in a table,

41
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,002
you can create one directly in your notebook.

42
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,001
Adding tables in your notes can also be helpful

43
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,002
in keeping groups of information together

44
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,009
and sorted appropriately.

45
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:26,004
To add a table to your notes, select Insert, then Table.

46
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:30,001
Next, select how many rows and columns you need.

47
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:35,001
The amount selected will be highlighted.

48
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,004
When you work in a table,

49
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,008
the table menu becomes available in the ribbon.

50
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,006
You can also right click on the table

51
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:45,007
to have the menu appear.

52
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:50,001
Select Table to further customize your table,

53
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:56,003
like insert or delete rows or columns.

54
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:59,004
Sometimes words just don't do enough.

55
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,002
Adding files, videos,

56
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,004
and tables helps to add dimension

57
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:06,002
and further clarification to your notes.

58
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,001
