00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,006
- Calls are a great tool for team meetings and quick chats.

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:05,007
It's important to have the right settings

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:07,005
just in case you miss a call

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:09,007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to manage

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:12,004
your call settings on Teams.

6
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,007
To get started, I'll open Teams

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:21,001
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

8
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,005
Next to your profile picture near the top,

9
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:27,008
select the three dots for more options.

10
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:32,004
Then select Settings.

11
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,008
Now, let's say you'll be out of the office

12
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:38,001
and you want to forward your incoming calls.

13
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:43,001
On the left menu, go to Calls

14
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:49,003
and under Call answering rules, choose Forward my calls

15
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:53,001
and Teams will forward all calls directly to your voicemail.

16
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:58,005
If you select Configure voicemail under Voicemail,

17
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,008
you will be able to record a greeting.

18
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,001
You can also select how you would like Teams

19
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:10,000
to handle calls when a caller goes to voicemail.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,008
They can record a message,

21
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:13,000
choose to record a message

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,002
or be transferred to someone else,

23
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,007
end the call without playing your greeting,

24
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:20,000
play the greeting and end the call,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,007
or just be transferred to someone else of your choosing.

26
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:28,002
If you select Transfer the call to someone else,

27
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,002
you will need to designate a person

28
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:32,004
for the call to be transferred to.

29
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:38,001
I'll select Isaiah.

30
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,006
When a caller calls you,

31
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:42,004
the call will be transferred to the designated person.

32
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:45,003
You can also specify the language for your greeting,

33
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:49,008
as well as customize a text-to-speech greeting option.

34
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,001
This option allows you to have a written greeting

35
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:55,005
and would replace your voicemail.

36
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,000
Should you want to create a custom

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
out of office text greeting,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,002
place your cursor below where it says

39
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:03,006
Your custom out of office greeting

40
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:07,007
and write your out of office greeting.

41
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll write I'm out of the office.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,009
Feel free to send me an email.

43
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,000
Below it, you can select when your out of office

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,006
custom greeting will display.

45
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:25,008
Select OK to save your changes.

46
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,003
I encourage you to put the proper settings in place

47
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,006
to manage your calls so that you can make sure

48
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:33,008
all calls are answered according to your availability.

49
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:34,008
Give it a try.
