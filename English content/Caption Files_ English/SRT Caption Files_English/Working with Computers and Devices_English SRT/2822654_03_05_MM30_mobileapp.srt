1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,009
- [Instructor] In addition to the applications you use

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,008
on your desktop or laptop computer,

3
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,006
you'll probably also spend a lot of time

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,000
working with apps on your mobile phone or tablet.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,005
Apps behave similarly on mobile devices

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,009
compared to desktop apps,

7
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,007
but you'll often find more limitations to mobile apps

8
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,007
in terms of power, functionality and ease of use.

9
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:21,003
Now, this isn't to say that you can't get work done,

10
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,009
play games and perform other tasks on your mobile phone.

11
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:25,005
You definitely can.

12
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:26,007
And apps for mobile devices

13
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,002
are usually designed specifically

14
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,009
for optimizing the experience of using a smaller screen

15
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,004
and a virtual keyboard.

16
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:35,002
Mobile apps are generally good for brief periods of work,

17
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,004
especially on phones.

18
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,004
Tablets with their larger screens

19
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,009
are more suitable for extended periods of work.

20
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,009
But with the prevalence of wifi

21
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,006
and cellular connections on mobile devices these days,

22
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:48,007
it's easy to not just to work and play on a mobile device,

23
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:52,003
but also to continue your work on a desktop computer later.

24
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:54,005
For example, let's say I'm working on a document here

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,006
in Microsoft Word on my phone during my morning commute.

26
00:00:57,006 --> 00:01:00,003
It's a little difficult to see, but I can zoom in.

27
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,005
And when I need to make edits,

28
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,000
I can just tap on the screen and a keyboard will appear.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,003
Now, I have this document saved over the internet

30
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:08,009
to my OneDrive account, which is a cloud-based service

31
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,000
I can store my documents on.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,002
Then, later, when I arrive at my office,

33
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,002
I can open up the desktop version of Word

34
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,003
and here open the same document from OneDrive

35
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:18,005
and keep working on it.

36
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:20,001
But now, on a much larger screen

37
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,006
with a full range of editing tools

38
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,009
found in the desktop version of Word.

39
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,002
Or I might add a lunch meeting to my calendar

40
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,005
here in Microsoft Outlook on my computer.

41
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,006
But later, on my commute home,

42
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,008
I realize I need to change the appointment to another day.

43
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,003
I can open up the mobile version of Outlook on my phone,

44
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:40,008
see all of my appointments and make my changes.

45
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,001
You'll find that many work and productivity apps

46
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,004
now have this ability to sync over the internet

47
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,003
so you can work seamlessly between devices,

48
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,009
making your mobile devices

49
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:51,004
an extension of your desktop computer, in a sense.

50
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:53,004
But lots of mobile apps are also designed

51
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,004
as standalone apps on your phone or tablet,

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,009
apps that are designed for a quick check of the weather,

53
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,008
or for finding driving directions,

54
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,007
or to check on the status of a flight.

55
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,005
Probably one of the biggest differences

56
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,000
between mobile and desktop apps

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,003
is that while you can acquire desktop apps

58
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,006
through many different places,

59
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:11,003
like the Microsoft Store or an app developer's website,

60
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:14,003
or purchase physical copies of applications in a store,

61
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:16,004
although, that's becoming less and less common,

62
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:18,001
mobile apps, on the other hand,

63
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,009
are acquired only through dedicated stores

64
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,004
like the Google Play Store

65
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:23,003
for apps that run on Android mobile devices,

66
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:24,009
and the Apple App Store

67
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,002
for apps that run on Apple's iOS mobile operating system.

68
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:31,000
These mobile app stores are your one-stop location

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,003
for every app you may want to install on your device.

70
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,006
You can browse through multiple categories,

71
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:38,007
or use the search feature to find specific apps.

72
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:41,002
When you select an app, you can read about its features,

73
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,007
check out reviews from people who have used the app.

74
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,009
And if you want the app,

75
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,001
you can download or purchase it to immediately install it.

76
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,007
Once apps are installed, you'll find their icons

77
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,006
among all the other apps you have on your device,

78
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,002
and you can tap them to start using them right away.
