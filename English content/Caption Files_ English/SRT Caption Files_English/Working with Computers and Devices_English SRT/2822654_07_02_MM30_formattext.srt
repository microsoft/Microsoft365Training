1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,005
- [Instructor] Once you have some text

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:02,006
in your Word document,

3
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,000
you can start formatting the text

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,007
to adjust how it appears on the page

5
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:09,004
in terms of its size, color, font face, and so on.

6
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:11,000
When it comes to formatting text,

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,001
all word processors follow the universal rule that the item

8
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,006
you want to format must be selected in order to be changed.

9
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,009
Selecting text usually means taking your mouse cursor

10
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:22,009
and dragging across the text you want to effect.

11
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,003
A quick way to select a single word

12
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,006
in your document is to double-click it.

13
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,009
But in this case, I want to select this entire heading.

14
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,001
So I'll just click and drag through it.

15
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,009
So selecting tells the word processor that

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,002
you want to effect only the text you've selected.

17
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,005
After you've selected your text,

18
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,003
you'll find your formatting tools.

19
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:41,000
Here in Word, we see formatting tools under the home tab.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,006
So with my text selected, I'll come up to the toolbar.

21
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:46,009
I'll click the B button, which makes my text bold.

22
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:48,005
We also have other buttons for formatting here,

23
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:52,000
like I for italicizing text and U for underlining.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,001
This is also where you'll find the menus

25
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:57,007
to change the font of your selected text, like so.

26
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,001
A useful shortcut in Word is the format painter,

27
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,008
which lets you apply the same formatting to other text.

28
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,007
So in this case, I made this heading bold,

29
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:06,004
and I changed its font.

30
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:07,009
With it still selected, I'm going to come up

31
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:10,009
to the home tab again and find the format painter.

32
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,004
I'll click, and then I'll select the second heading

33
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,005
with the format painter tool.

34
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,003
And just like that,

35
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,006
the same properties are applied to this text.

36
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:21,003
I can do it again by clicking format painter one more time

37
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,007
and selecting this third heading.

38
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,009
And there it is.

39
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,007
But again, the key to formatting text

40
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,000
in Word and all word processing applications

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
is to first select the text you want to change,

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,003
and then make your changes.
