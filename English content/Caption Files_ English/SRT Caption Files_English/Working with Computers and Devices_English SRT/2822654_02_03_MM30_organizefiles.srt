00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Illustrator] One of the most important concepts

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,008
to understand when working with computers

3
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:05,008
is the system for organizing, storing,

4
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:08,005
and locating your files and applications.

5
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,004
In this context, the term file, it refers to a single item,

6
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,001
such as a word processing document, a photo,

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,009
a video clip, a song and so on.

8
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,007
Applications are the programs that run on your computer,

9
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:21,004
which often use, interact with,

10
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,007
or create the files stored on your computer.

11
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:26,001
Another term you'll frequently hear is folder.

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,006
A folder is sometimes referred to as a directory,

13
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:29,009
but I think folder makes more sense

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,004
because it's easy to understand the concept of storing files

15
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:33,009
within folders.

16
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,000
Again, we're using the Windows 10 operating system

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,002
here for these examples,

18
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,006
but the concept recovering applied

19
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,006
to other operating systems as well.

20
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:44,007
Here in Windows 10, I'm going to click the file Explorer icon,

21
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,008
and that opens up a new window where we can navigate

22
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,006
and explore the contents of the computer.

23
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,009
But in this case, let's say I want to create a new folder

24
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,005
to store some of my business documents.

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,009
Now in each account, you already have some folders created,

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,003
which you can see over here in the left sidebar.

27
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:00,009
Let's click documents,

28
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,006
which is a good place to start my business documents.

29
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,000
You can see I already have a couple of files

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,001
and folders inside the documents folder,

31
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,001
but to stay organized,

32
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,003
I'm going to create a new folder

33
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,009
for my business-related documents.

34
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,000
There are a couple of ways to do this, but for this example,

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll click the home tab, here at the top of the window

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,004
and then select new folder.

37
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:20,008
And there it is.

38
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,008
By default, it's called New folder,

39
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,003
but notice the name is highlighted.

40
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,006
Meaning if I start typing while the text is selected,

41
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,008
I can give it a more meaningful name.

42
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,007
I'll call this folder business

43
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,006
and I'll press enter.

44
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:34,001
So there's my new folder.

45
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,007
I can open it by double-clicking it.

46
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,005
And as you'd expect, it's currently empty

47
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,004
because we just created it.

48
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,009
Now, just like how there are several ways

49
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,002
to create a new folder,

50
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,008
there are several ways to add files to that folder.

51
00:01:45,008 --> 00:01:48,000
For example, if I were working in Microsoft Excel

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,009
on a spreadsheet,

53
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,001
I could save that spreadsheet

54
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,004
and choose to store it in this folder.

55
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:55,005
Alternately, I can click the home tab again,

56
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,006
click the new item menu,

57
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:59,006
and here I'll find options for several types of files

58
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,000
I can create.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,005
So for example, I want to create a text document.

60
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,009
So I'll select that option,

61
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,000
and that instantly generates a new text document

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,006
inside this folder.

63
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,003
Just like when we created this folder,

64
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:13,008
the generic name of this new text document is highlighted,

65
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,009
so I can give it a better name.

66
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,001
Now, if you don't start typing

67
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,006
and you click outside that name,

68
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,002
you'll see that the highlight around the text is removed.

69
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:23,000
I can still rename this file though.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,003
I just need to click it once to select it,

71
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,005
pause for a second and then click it again.

72
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,006
And you can see the name highlights again.

73
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,005
The reason for pausing between clicks

74
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,004
is that if you click twice too quickly,

75
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:35,008
that's considered a Double-Click

76
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:38,007
which opens the item instead of highlighting its name.

77
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:40,002
So let's say I want to use this document

78
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,007
to keep some ideas for a book I'm working on.

79
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:46,005
I'll call this Book Ideas and I'll press return.

80
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,003
And now if I want to start working on this file,

81
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,009
I can double-click it,

82
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,008
which opens it in the default text editing application.

83
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:57,004
And I can start typing out some of my ideas

84
00:02:57,004 --> 00:03:00,001
when I close this file,

85
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:02,007
I'm prompted to save it so I don't lose my changes.

86
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,004
I'll click save.

87
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:08,004
And now I've created, edited and saved a text document.

88
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,005
But now that I think about it,

89
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,009
this doesn't really belong in this business folder.

90
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:15,001
Instead, I want to store this in a folder for my book ideas.

91
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:17,001
So I'll click the back button to go back

92
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,000
to the main document folder,

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,006
and here I'll create a new folder for my book ideas.

94
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,008
Another way to create a new folder

95
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,009
is to right-click within the folder

96
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:28,008
and then choose new folder.

97
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:32,002
There it is and I'll call this books.

98
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,001
Now, I need to move that book ideas document

99
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:37,000
I created in the business folder into the books folder.

100
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,001
Again, there are multiple ways to do this.

101
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,009
For this example, let's go back into the business folder

102
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,006
where that file currently is,

103
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:46,005
and now select it by clicking it once,

104
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:48,005
and I'll go to the home tab

105
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,006
and here I'll choose move to.

106
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:52,003
This gives me a list of folders on my computer

107
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,003
that I may want to move this file to,

108
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:56,009
but I don't see that new books folder I just created.

109
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:00,006
So I'll browse for that folder by selecting choose location.

110
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,005
This lets me navigate my entire computer

111
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:04,004
to locate the folder I need.

112
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:06,007
I'll start by opening up my user folder.

113
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:09,005
Here I'll find documents and within documents,

114
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:11,007
here's that new book's folder I created.

115
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,006
I'll select that and I'll choose move.

116
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:15,005
And just like that,

117
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,006
the file disappears out of the business folder.

118
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:20,001
And if I go back to the main documents folder

119
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:23,005
and look in books, there's the text file.

120
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,007
Now, another way to move files

121
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:27,003
is to simply drag them where you want them to be.

122
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,007
For example, if I want this file stored

123
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,003
in my main documents folder,

124
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,004
I can simply click and hold down on my mouse button

125
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:35,002
and then drag it to the document folder listing here

126
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:36,003
on the sidebar.

127
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:39,003
It says move to documents I'll release my mouse button,

128
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:41,002
and if I go back to the documents folder,

129
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:44,001
which I can do by clicking on documents up here this time,

130
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,007
you'll see book ideas is now sitting here

131
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:47,000
in the main folder.

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,004
But of course it really does make more sense

133
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:50,003
to leave it in the new book's folder here.

134
00:04:50,003 --> 00:04:53,001
So I'll drag it back in like so.

135
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,005
Now, if you no longer need a file,

136
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:56,006
you can always just delete it.

137
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,009
If I want to get rid of this Book Ideas file,

138
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,004
I can just select it,

139
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:04,002
and then under the home tab I can choose delete,

140
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:05,007
and it's gone.

141
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:07,009
Deleting files sends them to the recycle bin

142
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:11,008
on your desktop, which I can double-click to open.

143
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:12,009
And there it is.

144
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:14,005
So you don't have to worry about accidentally

145
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,007
deleting files.

146
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:18,003
If you made a mistake or you went to undelete a file,

147
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:20,000
you can just find it in the recycle bin.

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,007
As long as you haven't emptied the recycle bin,

149
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:23,008
which does permanently delete your files

150
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:25,005
and then just drag the file to place it back

151
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:28,008
into its folder or anywhere else you want to store it.

152
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,008
So if I move this window slightly out of the way,

153
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:32,002
I can grab book ideas

154
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:35,005
and drag it back into the books folder.

155
00:05:35,005 --> 00:05:37,005
So that's how to create new folders and files

156
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:38,008
and how to move, delete,

157
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,001
and recover those files.
