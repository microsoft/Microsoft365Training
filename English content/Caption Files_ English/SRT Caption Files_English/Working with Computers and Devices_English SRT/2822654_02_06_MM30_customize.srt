1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,009
- [Instructor] Operating systems are highly customizable,

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,002
making it easy to personalize your experience

3
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,008
to be more suited to everything from the way you work

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,006
to your personal taste and images and colors.

5
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,003
Let's take a look at some of the most popular ways

6
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:13,007
to customize the look and feel

7
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:16,005
of the Windows 10 operating system.

8
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:20,009
I'll click the Start button and select Settings.

9
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:24,007
And here in the Settings window, select personalization.

10
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,003
This is where you'll find the majority of settings

11
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:29,003
for personalizing your Windows 10 experience.

12
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,005
For example, to customize the look of your desktop,

13
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,005
make sure background is selected.

14
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:35,002
You can see I currently have a solid color

15
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,002
selected for my background.

16
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,007
And that lets you select any of these colors

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:43,004
to instantly apply them to your desktop.

18
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:46,007
Picture lets you choose from built in Windows photos,

19
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:49,005
like the ones you see here.

20
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,008
Or you can click Browse to choose

21
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:54,001
from one of your own photos from somewhere on your computer.

22
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:55,006
And slideshow lets you select

23
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,001
a folder of photos on your computer

24
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,009
and it will randomly display those photos

25
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:01,000
as your background.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,005
You can choose how often the photo changes

27
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,006
with this menu here.

28
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,001
Personally, I prefer a solid color,

29
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,006
so I'm going to switch back to that.

30
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,002
But you're free to customize your own background

31
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,002
however you like.

32
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,008
The color settings where you can customize

33
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,009
the colors of the operating systems various elements.

34
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,004
So here I can select from a variety of colors.

35
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:22,001
So I can switch from blue to red.

36
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,001
And this preview image at the top gives you an idea

37
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,005
of what will be affected by your choices.

38
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,003
But I can also see the changes right away.

39
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,004
Notice if I come down to my Start button, it's already red.

40
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,000
And many of the items within the start menu

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,006
are also highlighted in red.

42
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:38,006
If I scroll down a bit under default app mode,

43
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,007
I can choose light or dark,

44
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:42,004
basically letting me choose the overall mode

45
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,001
for the operating system.

46
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,000
So if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights,

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,007
you might want to choose the dark mode.

48
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,009
So using the computer screen for extended periods

49
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,004
is less straining.

50
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:53,007
I'll just switch back to light for now.

51
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,007
If you find it difficult to find a color combination

52
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:58,008
that works for you, try the theme settings.

53
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,004
Themes or groups of background images, colors, sounds

54
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:04,006
and so on, that have been designed to work well together.

55
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,001
Here you'll find some pre installed themes

56
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:11,001
that you can click on, and you can try a few of these out.

57
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,000
And you can see how that affects

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the look of the operating system.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,005
You can search for more themes in the Microsoft Store,

60
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,009
where it says get more themes in Microsoft Store,

61
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,008
or you can even further customize the theme.

62
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,006
So for example, if you like everything about the theme

63
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:25,008
except the color scheme, you can click the color option

64
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,006
and go back and select a different accent color.

65
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:30,008
I'm going to go back to themes

66
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:33,009
and set that back to my original theme for now.

67
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:37,000
Now lastly, you can also customize the taskbar.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,009
Within the settings you can lock or unlock the taskbar

69
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,006
to prevent accidentally moving or resizing it.

70
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,002
Under automatically hide the taskbar

71
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:46,004
you can enable this option to hide the taskbar hide

72
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:49,001
from view until you move your mouse to its location,

73
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,004
that can give you a little more space to work with.

74
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,003
You can also choose use small Taskbar buttons,

75
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,002
which gives you more room

76
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,009
if you've pinned a lot of applications to the taskbar.

77
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:00,003
And under taskbar location on screen,

78
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:02,005
you can even move the taskbar to other locations

79
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,006
like the left, right or top of the screen,

80
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,001
which you might want to do if an application

81
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,007
you're working with has menus or buttons

82
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,008
at the bottom of the screen,

83
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:10,009
and you don't want to accidentally click the taskbar

84
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:12,005
while working in the app.

85
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,000
So as you can see, it's pretty easy to customize Window 10

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,006
to personalize its appearance to work best for you.
