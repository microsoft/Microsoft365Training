1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,004
- [Instructor] Another common feature

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:03,007
found in the operating systems of modern devices

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:05,006
is a digital assistant.

4
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,007
You may have heard of Microsoft's Cortana,

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:11,000
Apple's Siri, or Google's Assistant.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,005
Virtual assistants use artificial intelligence, or AI,

7
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:15,007
to learn more about you

8
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,007
so they become more helpful the more you use them.

9
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:20,004
Here let's take a look at Cortana,

10
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:24,002
the virtual assistant built into Microsoft Windows 10.

11
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:26,001
You can interact with Cortana either through typing

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,008
on your computer's keyboard or by using your voice.

13
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,009
Bear in mind that your computer needs to have a microphone

14
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,000
in order for you to use your voice with Cortana.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,004
To use Cortana by typing,

16
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,004
you just click in the search box in the task bar

17
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,002
and type a question.

18
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,001
To you use your voice,

19
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,009
click the Talk to Cortana button next to the search box.

20
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,004
Let's say, for example, that I need to remember

21
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,007
to step away from my computer at 5:00 tomorrow

22
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,002
to cook dinner.

23
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:53,004
I'll click the Talk to Cortana button and say,

24
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:57,004
remind me to make dinner tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.

25
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,004
- [Cortana] Okay, great.

26
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,001
- [Instructor] And now when 5:00 p.m. arrives tomorrow,

27
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,007
Cortana will notify me with my reminder.

28
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:07,004
So that's just one example of what Cortana can do.

29
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,005
In addition to giving you time-based reminders,

30
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:12,008
Cortana can also track packages, give you sports scores,

31
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:16,007
track flights, send emails or texts, manage your calendar,

32
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:20,007
create and manage lists, and open any app on your system.

33
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,005
If you find yourself frequently using your voice

34
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,008
to interact with Cortana, you can apply a setting

35
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:27,000
so you don't have to click the Talk to Cortana button

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,002
in order to talk to Cortana.

37
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:34,004
Go to the Start menu and open Settings and select Cortana.

38
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:37,006
And here you can enable the Hey Cortana setting.

39
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,007
Once you've enabled this,

40
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,005
you can talk to Cortana at any time

41
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,006
just by saying, hey Cortana.

42
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,004
So I'll turn that on.

43
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,003
And I'll close Settings.

44
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:47,007
And let's try it.

45
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:51,007
Hey Cortana, show me images of Basset Hounds.

46
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:54,004
- [Cortana] I pulled up some images for you.

47
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,001
- [Instructor] And there we go.

48
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,009
I'll go ahead and close that.

49
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,005
Or since I'm making dinner tonight,

50
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:02,001
I'll ask Cortana to look up a recipe for me.

51
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:06,002
Hey Cortana, find a recipe for ratatouille.

52
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,004
- [Cortana] The first recipe is ratatouille

53
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:12,007
with 3.5 out of five stars on Martha Stewart.

54
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,005
- [Instructor] So as you can see,

55
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:16,005
Cortana searched the web and found me these recipes.

56
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,003
If any of them look good to me, I could click on them

57
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,006
to go to the webpage to get the recipe.

58
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,001
Probably one of the best ways to learn

59
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,008
about Cortana's abilities is to ask it questions

60
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:26,002
or to try seeing if it can perform

61
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,000
different activities for you.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,009
Or just say, hey Cortana, what can you help me do?

63
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,009
- [Cortana] Here's how I can help.

64
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,005
- [Instructor] And you'll get this list of useful commands

65
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,005
to try out to help you work more efficiently

66
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,005
and get things done.
