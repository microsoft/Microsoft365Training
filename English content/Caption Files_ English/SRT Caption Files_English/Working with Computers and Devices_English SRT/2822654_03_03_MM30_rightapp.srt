00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,003
- [Instructor] An important part of progressing beyond

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,008
the novice level of using computers

3
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:06,006
is being able to quickly determine which applications

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,002
to use to accomplish various tasks.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,002
Choosing the right application for your needs

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:13,004
is a skill that you can develop as you become more aware

7
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:16,008
of the types of applications available and how to use them.

8
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,005
As we've seen some apps come pre-installed

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,003
on your computer like calculator or Notepad,

10
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:24,000
but you can also install new apps on your computer.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,003
When we need to do that here in Windows 10 is by browsing

12
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,004
and searching the Microsoft Store.

13
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,003
Now the Store icon might be pinned in your task bar

14
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:31,005
like it is here,

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,007
in which case you can just click it to go to the Store,

16
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,008
but you can also find it by going to the start menu,

17
00:00:36,008 --> 00:00:37,007
and you should see the Store

18
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:40,002
as one of the tiles here in the menu.

19
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,007
If you don't see it you can just type Store

20
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,002
into the search bar and then select the Microsoft Store,

21
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,009
when it appears as one of the search results.

22
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,002
Any one of those options will open up the Store.

23
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,007
And here you can browse apps by category like gaming,

24
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:55,002
entertainment, productivity, and so on,

25
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:56,007
because apps are essentially tools

26
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,009
that fall into different categories.

27
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:59,009
Here in the Microsoft Store,

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,003
you'll find featured apps at the top of the screen.

29
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:03,002
As you scroll down,

30
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,009
you'll be able to browse through the available apps

31
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:06,009
under categories like best-selling apps,

32
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,000
which is a good place to find the most popular apps,

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,009
which could be an indicator of the apps

34
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,008
that you'll find useful,

35
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:13,008
or you'll find categories around specific tasks,

36
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:17,003
or activities like photo and video editing apps,

37
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,006
productivity apps, and so on.

38
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:21,002
Click on any app that looks interesting

39
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:23,003
to read more about it.

40
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:24,009
Here you'll find an overview of the app,

41
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,000
and you can read reviews,

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,004
view the system requirements for using the app and so on.

43
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,001
Now, if you're looking for a specific app,

44
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,006
you can type its name into the search bar

45
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:34,001
at the top of the window.

46
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,003
For instance, I'm looking for an app

47
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,004
called Microsoft Whiteboard,

48
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,007
so I'll type Whiteboard and there it is.

49
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,007
I'll click it to go to its product page.

50
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:43,007
And again, I can read more about it here.

51
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:45,002
And if I decide that I want to use,

52
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,008
or at least try this app, I just click get to install it.

53
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,008
Now in this case Whiteboard is a free app.

54
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:52,001
So the button says get.

55
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,009
If the app costs money you'll see a buy button.

56
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,009
Many paid apps also offer free trials on their Store pages.

57
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,009
So you can try them out for a limited time

58
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,008
to decide if you want to purchase them.

59
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,003
But again, this particular app is free

60
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:05,009
so I can install it by clicking get.

61
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,002
So from there, it will download,

62
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,006
and install onto my computer,

63
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:10,006
and I'll be able to use it right away.

64
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,008
Notice we now have a launch button,

65
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,007
so I can click launch to open up that app

66
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,005
here on my computer.

67
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll just close that for now.

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And I'll close the Store.

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,003
Now it's important to understand that certain types of files

70
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,006
require certain applications to open them.

71
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,002
For example, I have this document here on my desktop,

72
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:29,005
when I right click on it and go to the open with menu,

73
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,002
I'm presented with a list of apps I have installed

74
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:33,003
on my computer that can open this type of file,

75
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,006
in this case, Notepad and WordPad.

76
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:38,003
Similarly, if I right click on this photo file,

77
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,008
and go to open with,

78
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:41,007
I'll see a different set of photos on my computer

79
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:45,001
that are suitable for opening and editing photos.

80
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,008
If a friend or a colleague sends you a file

81
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:48,006
that you can't seem to open on your computer,

82
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:50,001
you'll need to check with them to see what app

83
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,007
they used to create that file,

84
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:53,005
and you may have to install that same app

85
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:56,002
or a similar app to access the file.

86
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,003
As you gain more experience using your computer,

87
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,001
you'll start to learn and understand which apps

88
00:03:00,001 --> 00:03:01,007
are the right apps to use to open,

89
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,007
and work with different types of files.

90
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:05,003
And if you often work with others,

91
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:06,009
you'll probably find that some or all of them

92
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,003
have the necessary software installed on their computers,

93
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:12,000
and it should be relatively easy to get recommendations

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,007
of what applications you need to accomplish your tasks.
