00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] When you first start up your computer,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,006
the first thing to load is the operating system.

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:07,000
For example, Windows 10 is the most recent version

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,002
of the Windows operating system that comes pre-installed

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,008
on many PCs and tablet devices.

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,005
Here we'll explore the basics of navigating

7
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,008
around an operating system using Windows 10,

8
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,003
but many of these concepts carry over

9
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:20,000
to other operating systems as well.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
When you start started the computer,

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,001
you'll usually see a screen to log into your account

12
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,005
on that computer.

13
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,003
Generally, it's a good idea for each person

14
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,004
using a computer to have their own account

15
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:31,003
rather than sharing an account between multiple users.

16
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,008
Individual accounts allow each user to keep their files

17
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:35,005
and work secured and organized

18
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:39,000
and let users personalize their experience on the computer.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,001
For example, one user could set the computer

20
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,006
to display text in English

21
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:45,005
while another user could set it to display in Spanish

22
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,007
and because accounts are secured by passwords,

23
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,002
neither user can see the other's documents or other files.

24
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:53,005
To log into the computer, select your username,

25
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,004
or sometimes you'll enter it manually

26
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:56,007
and then type in your password.

27
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,001
In Windows 10 when you set up your account,

28
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,004
you also have the option of setting up

29
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,008
a personal identification number or pin

30
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:05,002
which you can enter instead of your password.

31
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:07,005
So you'll either enter a password or a pin

32
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:08,009
in this case, I'm entering a password

33
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,003
and I'll press Enter on my keyboard

34
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:13,007
and that's going to log me into the computer.

35
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,004
Once you're logged in, the first thing you see

36
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:17,003
is your computer desktop.

37
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,004
Similar to a real physical desktop,

38
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,005
your computer desktop is where you store files

39
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,003
you're currently working with.

40
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,002
In most operating systems, you can personalize

41
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,008
the look of your desktop by changing the background image,

42
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:31,004
sometimes called the wallpaper or by changing the colors.

43
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:34,005
At the bottom of the Windows 10 desktop is the task bar,

44
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,002
which is an essential tool for working

45
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,002
with the Windows operating system.

46
00:01:38,002 --> 00:01:39,009
Depending on how you have it set up,

47
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,004
in the task bar you can see what apps are currently running,

48
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,008
what the current time is,

49
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:46,006
what appointments are on your calendar and so on.

50
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,008
On the far left of the task bar,

51
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,005
you'll find the Start button.

52
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,008
Clicking it opens up the Start menu

53
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:52,006
and this is where you can find

54
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,004
all the applications installed in your device.

55
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,005
This is also where you'll find the buttons to log off,

56
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:00,000
restart and shut down the computer.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,006
For now, let's click outside the Start menu

58
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:04,001
to close it without selecting anything.

59
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,004
Next to the Start button is the search box

60
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,003
where you can search for applications by name

61
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,001
or search for files and documents on your device.

62
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:12,008
Using the search box can be a lot quicker

63
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:15,008
than manually looking for applications in the Start menu.

64
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,005
Just start typing the name of the application

65
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,009
or document you want to work with

66
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:22,000
and Windows will display the search results as you type.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,008
For example, if I wanted to quickly open the calculator app,

68
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:27,002
I could just start typing calculator,

69
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,009
there it is, and I can just press Enter on my keyboard

70
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:31,003
to open that up.

71
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:33,006
Next to the search box, you'll see icons for applications

72
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:36,006
that are currently running or pinned to the task bar.

73
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,003
Pinned applications are apps that you can place

74
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:40,003
in the task bar to quickly access again

75
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,008
so you don't have to dig through the Start menu

76
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,002
to find them each time you want to open them.

77
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,006
Applications that are currently running

78
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:46,007
have a line underneath them

79
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,009
so you can easily tell if they're in use

80
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:51,004
as you can see here under the calculator icon.

81
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,001
To pin an application to the task bar,

82
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,006
place your mouse cursor over it

83
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,005
and then click the right mouse button on your mouse

84
00:02:56,005 --> 00:03:00,000
or pointing device, this is referred to as right click,

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,007
which often brings up a menu containing several options.

86
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:04,007
In this case, I'll choose to pin the calculator app

87
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:07,006
to the task bar since I use it a lot.

88
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:09,007
So now even if I close the calculator app

89
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:12,003
by clicking the X button here in the upper right corner,

90
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:14,005
notice this icon stays in the task bar.

91
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,009
We no longer see the blue line under it

92
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:18,002
because it's not running, but I can easily click

93
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:20,007
to open the calculator app from here now.

94
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,004
Also here within the pinned and running apps

95
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,002
is File Explorer.

96
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,000
Clicking that opens up a window you can use

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,009
to browse the files on your computer

98
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,000
and I'll just close that.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,004
The last section of the task bar is here on the right.

100
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,002
Here you usually see the date and time

101
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:35,009
along with various other icons

102
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,004
depending on how the computer's task bar

103
00:03:37,004 --> 00:03:39,000
has been customized.

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,008
Clicking on icons can give you more information

105
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:42,000
about the computer.

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,001
For example, clicking on the clock, displays the calendar,

107
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,002
clicking on the network icon

108
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:50,006
shows you the status of your network connection.

109
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:53,005
Clicking this arrow here reveals other icons

110
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:55,004
that may be hidden so the task bar isn't cluttered

111
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:57,003
with too many icons at once.

112
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,003
So for example, from here, I can click the speaker icon

113
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:01,005
and that allows me to adjust the volume

114
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,009
of the computer speakers.

115
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,003
So that's the task bar in Windows.

116
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:07,007
Now, when you're done using your computer,

117
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:10,001
it's usually a good idea to log out of your account

118
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,004
or to shut down the computer

119
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:13,004
if you don't need to leave it running.

120
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:15,005
To do so, click the Start button.

121
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,008
If you just want to log out, but leave the computer running,

122
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,009
for example, if someone else needs to log into their account

123
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,002
to use the computer, just click the user icon

124
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:26,000
at the top here, and then choose a Sign Out.

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,003
That will log you out of your account,

126
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,003
but leave the computer running

127
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:31,000
so someone else can sign into their account.

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ultimately, you can click the power button here

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,008
and from here, you can shut down or restart the computer.

130
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:39,002
Choose to Shut Down if you want to shut down the computer

131
00:04:39,002 --> 00:04:41,003
so it's not using any power.

132
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:42,009
And restart shuts down the computer

133
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:45,001
and immediately starts it again.

134
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,008
Sometimes restarting can fix issues

135
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:49,009
that may crop up while using the computer.

136
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,009
Again, we've been looking at the

137
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,001
Windows 10 operating system in this video,

138
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,007
but many of these concepts like searching for applications,

139
00:04:55,007 --> 00:04:58,004
accessing settings and logging out and restarting

140
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,006
apply to other operating systems as well.
