00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,000
- [Instructor] So what exactly does the term windows refer

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,006
to in regards to working with computers?

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:08,008
Essentially, any program or application that we open or view

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,001
in the operating system is a window.

5
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,008
It's what allows us to see what's going on

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,005
in that application and interact with it.

7
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,002
For example, if I come down to the task bar

8
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,004
and open up the File Explorer,

9
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:20,008
that opens a window that I can use

10
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,006
to browse the contents of my computer,

11
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,007
which is the purpose of File Explorer.

12
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,007
Or if I open up this text editor application,

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,009
this is that application's window.

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,007
And when I open up the calculator app,

15
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:35,004
that opens up in its own window as well.

16
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:37,006
So again, we refer to the area in which we view

17
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:41,004
and interact with apps and the operating system as windows.

18
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,006
And that term applies whether

19
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,008
you're working with Microsoft Windows 10,

20
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,009
macOS, or some other operating system.

21
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:49,009
Most windows share common properties.

22
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,009
For one, you can move them around on your screen by clicking

23
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,004
and holding down at the area at the top

24
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,004
and just dragging them around.

25
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,008
When working with multiple windows,

26
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:00,007
clicking any one of them brings that one to the front

27
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,003
so you can work with it.

28
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:05,000
And the other windows stay open behind it.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's close the text editor with the X button,

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,007
and I'll close the calculator as well.

31
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,000
So notice these three buttons

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,001
in the upper right hand corner of the windows.

33
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,007
We just saw to close or quit a window,

34
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,003
we click the X button.

35
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,007
Now, sometimes when working in certain applications,

36
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,001
you may need or want the window

37
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,005
to take up the entire screen

38
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:25,001
so you have more room to work in the window.

39
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,001
To do this in Windows 10,

40
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:29,002
just click this middle button called the maximize button.

41
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:31,009
And now this window fills the entire screen.

42
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,001
If that turns out to be larger than you want it to be,

43
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,000
you can return it to its previous size

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,001
by clicking what is now called the restore button.

45
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,004
You can adjust the size of windows

46
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,005
by placing the mouse cursor

47
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:44,001
over the top, bottom, left, or right edge.

48
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,005
So you see this double-headed arrow,

49
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,001
and then click and drag to adjust the height

50
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,000
or width of the window.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,004
Or you can place your cursor over a corner

52
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:54,004
to get this diagonal double-headed arrow

53
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,004
and drag to adjust the height and width at the same time.

54
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,006
Now, there may be times when you're working

55
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:01,004
with multiple windows and you want to declutter a bit,

56
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,005
but you also don't want to completely close a certain window

57
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,004
because you want to maintain quick access to its contents.

58
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:08,001
In those cases, click the third button,

59
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,004
which is the minimize button.

60
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:13,000
That minimizes the window to the task bar.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,008
To restore a minimized window,

62
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,009
just click its icon in the task bar.

63
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:21,000
If you have more than one window in a certain app minimized,

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,008
for example, if I open up the Recycle Bin window

65
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:27,009
and I minimize that along with the File Explorer window,

66
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:31,000
notice when I roll my mouse over the File Explorer icon,

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,001
I get a preview of the two minimized windows,

68
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,009
and I can click the one that I want to restore.

69
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll just go ahead and close that

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,004
along with the Recycle Bin.

71
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:42,006
Now, you'll often work with multiple applications

72
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:45,003
and therefore multiple windows simultaneously.

73
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:46,002
Let's say I need to be working

74
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:48,001
with both the Microsoft Edge web browser

75
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,002
and Microsoft Word at the same time.

76
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:51,000
There's a very easy way

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,004
to make sure you can see both windows at the same time

78
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,003
without them overlapping each other.

79
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:56,008
First, let's open up Word.

80
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:59,009
I'll do this by clicking in the search bar and typing Word.

81
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,008
I can see it's highlighted,

82
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:04,001
so I just need to press Enter to open up the app.

83
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,009
And I'll double-click to create a new blank document.

84
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,004
I'm going to click the restore button here in Word

85
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:11,002
to make it its own floating window.

86
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:13,008
But now I'm going to click and hold its title bar

87
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:16,008
and drag it to one side of my screen

88
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:18,009
until I see this highlight appear,

89
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:21,000
and I can release my mouse.

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,003
That snaps the Word window to the left side of the screen.

91
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,004
Now let's open up Microsoft Edge.

92
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:28,002
And again, I'll just search for Edge,

93
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:31,002
and I'll press Enter to open it up.

94
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,008
And there it is.

95
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,006
Again, I'll click the restore button.

96
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,002
That allows me to drag the window around.

97
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:37,005
And this time I'll drag to the right

98
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,002
until I see a highlight.

99
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,005
And when I release my mouse button, it snaps to the right,

100
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:43,009
and I can see both the Word and Edge application windows

101
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:46,005
at the same time, and it's easy to click back and forth

102
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,005
between the two of them

103
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:49,000
to work with the one I need to work with

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,006
without hiding the other one.

105
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:52,005
So for example, I could be doing research in Edge

106
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:55,001
for a report that I'm typing in Word.

107
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,009
And this continues to work if I need to access more windows.

108
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,004
For example, I'll open up File Explorer again,

109
00:04:01,004 --> 00:04:03,005
and I'll drag it to the right.

110
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:04,009
That makes it fill half the screen

111
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,007
so I can work with Word and File Explorer together.

112
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,003
But if I need to work with Edge again,

113
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:12,002
I just click its icon in the task bar,

114
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,009
and it comes to the front of File Explorer,

115
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,003
maintaining its size.

116
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,008
So I could continue to switch back and forth

117
00:04:16,008 --> 00:04:19,008
between Edge and File Explorer as need be.

118
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,005
Knowing how to work with windows is essential

119
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,005
to make it easier for you

120
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:24,003
to get things done on your computer.
