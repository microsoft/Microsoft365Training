00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,004
- [Instructor] Just about any time

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,008
you work in an application

3
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:04,007
in which you are creating, editing,

4
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:07,003
or otherwise modifying some kind of content,

5
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:10,003
you'll be producing and saving your work as files.

6
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:13,000
For example, when you type up a report in a word processor,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,002
the report is saved as an individual file,

8
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,001
which you can then reopen in the application

9
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,007
to continue working on it.

10
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:20,000
Or if you're editing a video

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,006
you shot of a grade school recital,

12
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,004
you're saving that video project as a file too.

13
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,007
So it's important to understand the basic concepts involved

14
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,007
in opening and saving files.

15
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,009
For this example, I'll open up a built-in application

16
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,000
in Windows 10 called Notepad.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,003
I can find it by going to the Start menu,

18
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:39,009
scrolling down to Windows Accessories, and here is Notepad.

19
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,003
And once I select that app,

20
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:44,006
it starts and opens a new blank document for me to type in.

21
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:47,006
Now in some apps, to create a new document or other project,

22
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,007
you need to choose File, New.

23
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,007
But in the case of Notepad,

24
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,006
it automatically created a new document for me.

25
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:56,004
And I'll just type a few words here.

26
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,007
Now anytime you're actively working

27
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,001
on a document or a project,

28
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:01,007
it's a good practice to save your file periodically

29
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,005
so you don't lose your work should the electricity go out

30
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,004
or some other issue with your computer pops up.

31
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:11,002
To save what I've written so far, I'll choose File, Save.

32
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,001
That opens this window,

33
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,001
prompting me to choose a location on my computer to save it.

34
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,006
Notice it's automatically selected My Documents folder,

35
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:19,008
but I can navigate to any other part of my computer,

36
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,006
for example, maybe I'll just save this on the desktop.

37
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:23,009
I also should name the file.

38
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,009
Right now it just has an asterisk in place of the file name,

39
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,000
but it also has this dot txt as part of the name.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,005
That txt is called a file extension.

41
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:34,001
The purpose of including a file extension

42
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,003
in the name of your file

43
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,006
is to identify what kind of file this is.

44
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:39,004
So if it needs to be opened by someone else,

45
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:41,000
their computer has a better chance of knowing

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,003
which application to use to open it.

47
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:46,006
So plain text files like this one are dot txt files,

48
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,008
Microsoft Word files are dot doc,

49
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,002
Adobe Photoshop files or dot psd and so on.

50
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,004
For the most part, your computer will be able to open files

51
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,008
with hidden or missing extensions

52
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:58,003
with the right applications,

53
00:01:58,003 --> 00:01:59,005
but if you have to share this file

54
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:01,006
with someone running a different operating system,

55
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:04,005
their computer might not know what application to use.

56
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,006
So I always leave the extension as part of the file name,

57
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,005
and I suggest you do too.

58
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:13,000
So I'm going to save this on my desktop as story.txt.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,005
I'll click Save.

60
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:15,009
And now my document is saved,

61
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,006
and you can see it sitting here on the desktop.

62
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:21,000
Now I'm going to close Notepad.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,006
If I want to reopen that file,

64
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,004
the fastest way to do so in this instance

65
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:25,006
is to double click it

66
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:28,009
since it's sitting here in plain view on my desktop.

67
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:30,002
Now if Notepad is already open,

68
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:31,006
and I want to open a different document

69
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,008
I previously worked on,

70
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:35,003
I could choose File, Open,

71
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:36,006
which lets me browse for my file

72
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,007
wherever it is on my computer.

73
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:41,007
Many applications also have a file open recent command,

74
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:42,005
which gives you a list

75
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:44,000
of your most recently opened documents

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,009
so you have quick access to them.

77
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,008
Notepad being a very basic text editor

78
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,004
doesn't have this option.

79
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,007
But there's a slightly more powerful built-in word processor

80
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,001
called WordPad in accessories.

81
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:59,001
Again, I'll go to the Start menu, to Windows Accessories,

82
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:01,005
and here I'll locate WordPad.

83
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,008
Now, WordPad's File menu

84
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:04,002
looks a little different than Notepad's,

85
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:05,009
but you get the same options.

86
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:10,005
When I click File, you can see New, Save and Open.

87
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:12,003
We also have a Recent documents area,

88
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:14,000
which we can see over here to the right.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,001
And that shows me the documents

90
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,008
I've most recently worked with in WordPad,

91
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:19,003
and I can select them here to open them up again.

92
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:20,008
And you'll find that most other applications

93
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,008
also offer the ability

94
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,005
to open recently used documents and files.

95
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,007
All right, so those are the basic things

96
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:28,004
you should understand about opening and saving files.

97
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:29,002
What I've shown you here

98
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,005
applies to almost every application out there.

99
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:32,008
You will find some applications

100
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,009
that save your files or data automatically

101
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,003
and don't even offer a save command

102
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,008
so you can do it yourself,

103
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,000
but those are much more rare,

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,004
and you should still get into the habit

105
00:03:40,004 --> 00:03:43,000
of saving your files regularly while working on them.
