00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] When learning to use the apps

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:02,008
in Microsoft Office,

3
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,000
it can sometimes take a little time to find the features

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,002
and tools needed for your work.

5
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,006
But at the top of each Office app,

6
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,004
you'll find the search bar.

7
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:12,004
In some applications, a search bar like this

8
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,002
often lets you look up instructions on how

9
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:17,005
to accomplish tasks or locate the features you need.

10
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,008
But the Microsoft search field goes a step further

11
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,001
by giving direct access to the features you need

12
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,005
without having to hunt through the tabs

13
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,005
in the ribbon or in the menu bar.

14
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:28,001
For example, I'm currently working in this Word document

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,004
and maybe I want to look up how

16
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,003
to adjust the size of margins on the page.

17
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:35,006
So I'll click in the search field and type margins.

18
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,004
So at the bottom, I can see that it searched my document

19
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,001
for the word margins in case that's what I'm looking for,

20
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:41,005
and there are no results there.

21
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,005
Above that, I can roll my mouse over the Get Help On section

22
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,007
to read entries about where to go in Word

23
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,006
to adjust margins.

24
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:50,003
There's even a dictionary definition of margins here,

25
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,008
but what I'm really interested in is this Best Action area

26
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:53,009
at the top.

27
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,006
This actually gives me access to the settings

28
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,006
to adjust the margins right from here.

29
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,008
I don't need to hunt around anywhere else in Word,

30
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:02,007
I can just select, say, the Narrow setting

31
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:05,005
and that adjustment is instantly made to my document.

32
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:08,004
Or maybe I want to adjust the space between paragraphs.

33
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:11,009
I'll select my text here and in the search field,

34
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,003
I'll type spacing.

35
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:16,001
Again, under Best Action, Word is offering access

36
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,002
to what it thinks are the settings I most likely want,

37
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,004
in this case line and paragraph spacing.

38
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:23,002
But you may find other suggestions under Actions,

39
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:25,004
and here's the paragraph spacing I want.

40
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:26,007
That opens the correct window for me,

41
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,005
where I can find the paragraph spacing settings,

42
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,006
make some changes and click Okay.

43
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:34,003
So the Microsoft search bar is a great tool to turn to

44
00:01:34,003 --> 00:01:36,002
anytime there's a feature you can't find,

45
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,004
or you're not sure how to accomplish a task.

46
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,009
Just type in what you're looking for,

47
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,005
check the actions that it lists

48
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:43,004
and make your adjustments from there.
