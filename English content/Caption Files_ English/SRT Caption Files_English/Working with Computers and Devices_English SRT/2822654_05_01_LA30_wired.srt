00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,002
- Let's take a look at how to connect your computer

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:06,004
to your network via a wired Ethernet connection.

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,009
Now, this assumes that your network has already been set up

4
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:11,006
in your home, office, or classroom.

5
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,004
If you're connecting to your home network,

6
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,002
you're most likely going to run an Ethernet cable

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:18,000
from your computer directly into your router.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,001
If you're connecting in an office or classroom environment,

9
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,002
chances are you'll be running an Ethernet cable

10
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:26,002
from your computer into an Ethernet port on the wall

11
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:27,005
or some other fixture,

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,000
which in turn connects to your network.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,006
In any case, the important thing is

14
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:33,007
that you have a cable running from whatever the source

15
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,001
of your network connection is

16
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,006
into the Ethernet port on your computer.

17
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:40,006
Nearly all desktop computers have built-in Ethernet ports,

18
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:43,000
though you're not seeing them as much on laptops these days,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,005
as in the past.

20
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,004
If your laptop doesn't have Ethernet

21
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,002
or if you're using a tablet or a mobile phone,

22
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:51,000
you'll connect wirelessly to your network,

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,009
which we'll look at how to do later.

24
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,005
This case, though, I'll just plug the cable

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,009
that's running from my desktop's Ethernet port

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,008
right into my router.

27
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:01,006
And once you have your computer connected

28
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,001
to your network via Ethernet,

29
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,001
chances are you're already on your network

30
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,006
and you're so-called setup is done.

31
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,007
In most cases, once you connect your computer

32
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:11,007
to your network with an Ethernet cable,

33
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,007
you'll automatically be connected to the network and be able

34
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,009
to communicate with other computers on the network,

35
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,005
as well as access the internet.
