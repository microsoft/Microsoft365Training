00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,009
- Many of today's computers, especially portable devices,

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,002
like laptops and tablet computers,

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,008
include a technology called Bluetooth.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,006
Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology,

5
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:14,004
mostly used to reduce the use of cables.

6
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,001
You're probably familiar with this technology

7
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,001
in the form of Bluetooth headsets

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,001
that many people use to talk on their mobile phones.

9
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,003
But Bluetooth is also used for many other types of devices,

10
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:26,007
like replacing a wired keyboard or mouse

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,003
to eliminate the clutter of cables

12
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:32,000
normally needed to connect those devices to your computer.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,006
Now, because we are dealing with a wireless technology,

14
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,001
the important thing is to make sure

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,005
that your Bluetooth device such as a mouse and your computer

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,009
recognize each other

17
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,002
and that someone nearby can't take control of your computer

18
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,003
with their Bluetooth mouse.

19
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,002
You accomplish this

20
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:49,002
by performing a task called pairing your devices.

21
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's take a look at how we do this.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,008
For this example, I'm going to set up a Bluetooth mouse.

23
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,008
The first thing you need to do

24
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:58,006
is to set your Bluetooth device into pairing mode

25
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,008
also called discoverable mode.

26
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,001
You'll have to check the instructions

27
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:04,006
for whatever device you're trying to pair with your computer

28
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:07,000
to see how to put it into this mode.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,005
I'll go ahead and do that to my mouse right now.

30
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,002
Now, you may immediately see a notification

31
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,000
letting you know that your device was detected,

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,005
and you'll be able to connect to it right from there.

33
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:19,001
If you don't see that notification or you miss clicking it,

34
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:21,005
you can go into settings to connect your device.

35
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:22,004
Here in Windows 10,

36
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:27,009
I'm going to go to the Start menu, to Settings, Devices,

37
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,000
and I'll make sure that Bluetooth

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,001
and other devices is selected.

39
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,001
I'll make sure that the Bluetooth switch is on,

40
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,000
and I'll click Add Bluetooth or other device.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,006
I'll say that I want to connect a Bluetooth device.

42
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,006
And after a moment, my mouse's name appears in this window.

43
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:43,002
I can select it,

44
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:45,006
and Windows will just take a moment to install the device.

45
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:46,008
Now, depending on your device,

46
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,007
you might be prompted to type in a passcode

47
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,000
in order to complete the pairing process.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,003
This is an extra security measure some devices use

49
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:55,003
to make sure the person controlling the computer

50
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,006
is the one who wants to pair with the device.

51
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:59,004
If your device requires a passcode,

52
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:01,006
you'll find the code in your instruction manual.

53
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,005
But as you just saw,

54
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:04,000
that wasn't required for this mouse,

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and after a few seconds,

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,005
I got this message saying my device is ready to go.

57
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,009
I'll click Done.

58
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,004
I see my device listed here,

59
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,005
and I can begin using my mouse right away.

60
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:15,001
Now, you only need to set up your Bluetooth device once.

61
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,009
After that, anytime your Bluetooth mouse, keyboard,

62
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,002
or any other paired device

63
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,008
is switched on near your computer,

64
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,007
they should automatically connect.

65
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,009
Now, if you ever want to unpair your mouse from your PC,

66
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,005
just come back into Bluetooth settings, select the device,

67
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:32,002
click Remove Device and confirm that you want to do that.

68
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,004
You can see it's been removed

69
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,005
and now this mouse will no longer work with my computer

70
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,002
until I pair them again.

71
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,002
And that's it.

72
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:40,003
This pairing process is pretty much the same

73
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:42,007
regardless of the type of device you're using.

74
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:45,006
Just put your device into pairing or discoverable mode,

75
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:48,002
open up Bluetooth settings, select your device,

76
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,006
and let windows do the rest.
