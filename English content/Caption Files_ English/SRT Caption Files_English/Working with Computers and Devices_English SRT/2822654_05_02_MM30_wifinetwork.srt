00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] A wireless network is a network

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,006
to which properly equipped computers

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:07,001
can connect via radio signal instead of physical cables.

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,006
Wireless networks are commonly called Wi-Fi networks

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:12,000
and allow computers and mobile devices to connect

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,008
to the internet without the need for a cable.

7
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:16,003
Like a regular wired network,

8
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,003
a Wi-Fi network does not necessarily have

9
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:20,000
to offer internet access,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,006
although internet access is probably the most common reason

11
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,008
people set up Wi-Fi networks.

12
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,000
To connect to a nearby wireless network,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,009
you should see this network icon here in your taskbar.

14
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,003
If you don't see it, right-click on the taskbar

15
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,005
and choose Taskbar settings,

16
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,004
then click Turn system icons on or off.

17
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:41,001
And here, make sure the Network switch is turned on.

18
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,006
So with Wi-Fi enabled on your computer

19
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,005
when you click the Network icon,

20
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,004
you'll see a list of all the nearby Wi-Fi networks

21
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,002
your computer has detected.

22
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,006
The Wi-Fi icon next to each one

23
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,000
also shows you how strong the signal is.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,003
Click a network to reveal the Connect button.

25
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,001
You can check Connect automatically

26
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,009
if you want your PC to automatically connect

27
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:00,008
to this network in the future without first asking you.

28
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,001
This is a convenient time saver,

29
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:03,009
especially for networks you use all the time

30
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,008
like your home or office network.

31
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:08,001
Then click Connect to join the network.

32
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,009
If the network you're trying to join is secured,

33
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:11,005
as most of them are these days,

34
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,007
you'll be prompted to type in the password.

35
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,009
And I'll click Next.

36
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,005
And now I'm connected.

37
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,005
Notice that my network icon in my taskbar

38
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:22,000
has turned into a Wi-Fi icon.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,004
So at this point I'm connected to that Wi-Fi network,

40
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,005
and I'm free to connect to other computers on the network

41
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,002
or to surf the web.

42
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,008
Now, if you followed these steps and were unable to connect,

43
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,009
or it looks like you're connected

44
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,003
but you can't get online,

45
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:35,009
first make sure you're close enough to the Wi-Fi signal.

46
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,001
Ideally you want to have as close to three full bars

47
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,005
in the signal strength indicator as possible.

48
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:42,007
If you're connecting to a public Wi-Fi network,

49
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:44,008
you might have to pay to use the service.

50
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:46,009
In most cases, you just need to open your web browser

51
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,005
and try to open a webpage.

52
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:51,002
You'll then be redirected to a page where you'll be asked

53
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,009
to submit your credit card information,

54
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,001
or your room number in some hotels, before you can proceed.

55
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:58,000
When you come across Wi-Fi networks like that,

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,002
just follow the onscreen instructions.

57
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:01,002
But for the most part,

58
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:03,003
connecting to a wireless network from your PC

59
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:04,009
is a simple matter of selecting the network

60
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,005
from the list of available networks

61
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,008
and then clicking Connect.
