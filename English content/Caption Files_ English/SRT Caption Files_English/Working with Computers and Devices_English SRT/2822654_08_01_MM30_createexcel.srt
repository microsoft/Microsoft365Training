1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,007
- The first step to working with spreadsheets

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:05,008
in Microsoft Excel is to open an existing workbook

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,007
or to create a brand new one.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,005
You can start from scratch with a completely blank workbook

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,002
or use one of the many available templates

6
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,004
included with Office to create workbooks

7
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:18,004
for making calendars, managing budgets, generating invoices,

8
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:20,009
and lots more.

9
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:22,007
To create a new workbook, open Excel.

10
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:24,005
And with the Home tab selected,

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:26,001
you can click Blank workbook

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,000
to instantly create a new empty spreadsheet

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,008
and start entering content into the cells right away.

14
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:34,000
Or to create a new workbook based on a template,

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,008
from here, go to File,

16
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,006
and then select New.

17
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,005
And below the blank workbook option,

18
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,009
you'll find a large collection of templates to choose from,

19
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,003
and you can scroll to browse through the templates.

20
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:46,005
Or you can scroll back up and type a search term

21
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,001
to look for online templates.

22
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,006
I'll search for budget.

23
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:53,004
And you can see these are all budget related templates now.

24
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,008
Click any template to get a closer look

25
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,003
and to read a description.

26
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,001
And when you find a template you'd like to use,

27
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,002
click Create.

28
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,008
Let's zoom out a little here so we can see the whole thing.

29
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,009
Now, the advantage of using a template like this

30
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:06,006
is that it already includes formulas

31
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:08,003
to perform these calculations.

32
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:09,004
You'll be able to see the numbers

33
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:14,004
and this Percentage bar updating as I make changes.

34
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:15,007
Once you started making changes

35
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,003
or adding content to your workbook,

36
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,006
you should save it so you don't lose those changes.

37
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:23,006
One way to do this is to click File and then Save as.

38
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,006
Then choose a location to save the file.

39
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,004
If you have a OneDrive account set up,

40
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,008
you can save to your OneDrive folder

41
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,004
to save your document to the cloud

42
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,002
so you'll be able to access it from anywhere

43
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,001
on any device running Excel.

44
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:35,003
Or you can choose to save it locally

45
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:38,005
to the computer you're currently using by choosing Browse.

46
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,001
Navigate to the location on your computer

47
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:41,008
where you want to save your file.

48
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,004
My Documents folder is currently selected,

49
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:44,006
which is where I'll leave it.

50
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:45,007
Then name your file.

51
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:48,003
I'll keep the current name of Monthly Food Budget

52
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,006
and I'll click Save.

53
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,006
So it's now saved to my Documents folder,

54
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:53,008
and I can see that if I go to the Start menu

55
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:56,007
and select Documents to open up that folder

56
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,003
and there it is.

57
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:00,001
So now I can continue working on my spreadsheet

58
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,000
here in Excel.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,003
As you work, it's a good idea to periodically save your file

60
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:06,005
to make sure you don't lose your changes.

61
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,003
Once you've saved your file the first time,

62
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,007
you can quickly save it again by clicking the Save button

63
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:12,004
at the top of the Excel window.

64
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:15,002
So that's how to create and save a new workbook in Excel.
