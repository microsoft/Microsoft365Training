00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] If you're working in a word document

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,008
that contains a lot of text and you need

3
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:05,007
to replace a word or sentence,

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,004
you can use the built-in Find and Replace feature.

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:09,007
This can be useful, for example,

6
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,008
if you realize you've been spelling someone's name wrong

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,004
throughout the entire document,

8
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,002
or some new information has changed some data

9
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:18,000
in your document that you now need to update.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,005
Under the Home tab here in Word,

11
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,002
you'll locate the editing section.

12
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:24,000
And this is where you'll find the Find and Replace buttons.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,001
So for example, I've noticed in this document

14
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,000
about the history of the Landon Hotel

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,005
that the founder Arthur Landon's name is misspelled

16
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:32,007
in a couple of different places.

17
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:34,001
You can see here the name is spelled with an A

18
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,000
instead of an O.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It would be time consuming

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,003
to read through the entire document

21
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,002
to locate each instance of this mistake.

22
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:43,005
So instead, I'm going to click the replace button.

23
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,004
In the Find What field, I'll type the word

24
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,001
that I'm looking for, which is the incorrect spelling

25
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,008
of Landon and in the Replace field,

26
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,007
I'll type the correct spelling of the name.

27
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,006
At this point,

28
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:57,000
you have a few options on how to find or replace this text.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,008
If you click Find Next,

30
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:00,008
the first instance where it finds of the spelling

31
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,003
will be highlighted.

32
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:05,004
If I want to fix this instance, I click Replace.

33
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:07,000
I move this out of the way.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,009
You can see that's now been fixed.

35
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:10,008
Word then jumps to the next instance.

36
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,008
But since I know that I want to correct all the instances

37
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:15,008
of this misspelling, I can click Replace All,

38
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,009
and Word will automatically change every instance

39
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,000
in the document.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,004
And I get this notification telling me

41
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,005
that it made three replacements.

42
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,001
I'll click Okay.

43
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,006
And I'll Close.

44
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:27,007
So that's the find and replace feature in Word.

45
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,008
And again, it can be a big time saver,

46
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:32,008
especially in longer documents containing a lot of text.
