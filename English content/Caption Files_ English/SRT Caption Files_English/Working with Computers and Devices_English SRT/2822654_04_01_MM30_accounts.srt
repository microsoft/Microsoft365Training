1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,005
- If you share a computer with others,

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:05,005
it's a good idea for each user to have their own account.

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,001
Everyone having their own account

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,001
is better for security reasons.

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,003
For instance no one can access anyone else's account

6
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,007
without their password.

7
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:15,002
But it's also good for personal organization

8
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:16,006
of everyone's files.

9
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,002
Meaning your files won't be mixed in

10
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,001
with everyone else's files.

11
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:22,003
All modern operating systems with the exception

12
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:23,009
of some mobile operating systems,

13
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,000
allow you to create individual accounts

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,006
for each separate user of that computer.

15
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:31,000
In Windows 10, for example,

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,003
you can create new user accounts

17
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:36,003
by going to the start menu, opening settings,

18
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:40,005
going to accounts, and selecting family and other users.

19
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,002
And from here, you can add a family member if for instance,

20
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,008
you want to add an account for a kid that you can monitor,

21
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:48,002
or you can choose add someone else to this PC

22
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:50,002
to create an individual user account for someone

23
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,001
who's not part of your family.

24
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,004
I'll just close that for now.

25
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:55,008
So again the point of having individual accounts

26
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:58,006
is that each account on the computer is password protected

27
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:01,004
so only the individual user can access to that account,

28
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:02,009
which in turn provides more security

29
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,006
for everyone else's files.

30
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:07,008
Each user has their own user folder on the computer.

31
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,001
Let's see how to get to that user folder

32
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,001
so we can take a closer look at it.

33
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:12,002
Now there are faster ways to get

34
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,002
to some of the folders inside your user folder

35
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,005
than what I'm about to show you.

36
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,001
But I also want you to see exactly

37
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,007
where this folder is located. So bear with me.

38
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:20,009
Currently I don't have any windows

39
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,008
or any applications running.

40
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,001
I'm going to open up File Explorer

41
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,009
by clicking this icon here in the task bar.

42
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,005
And then in the left sidebar of the window

43
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:33,005
that opens under this PC, I'm going to select local disc.

44
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:35,003
This local disc labeled the C drive

45
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,004
is my main or startup hard drive containing

46
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,009
the operating system and other important folders.

47
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,007
Now most of these folders you see here

48
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:43,005
are for the windows operating systems use,

49
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,003
and you generally don't want to mess around in them

50
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:46,009
unless you know what you're doing.

51
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,003
But this is also where you'll find the user's folder.

52
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,009
I'll double click it to open it.

53
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,007
In the user's folder,

54
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:53,007
you'll find a folder for each account on your computer

55
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:55,000
with the user's name on it,

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
or whatever the name of the account is.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,004
To view the contents of your user folder, double click it.

58
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:03,001
So again your user folder is your folder.

59
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,000
It's where you can store all of your documents,

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,008
music, photos, videos, and so on.

61
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,001
Now you can store files in other parts of your hard drive,

62
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,005
but there are very few reasons to do that.

63
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:14,003
It's best to keep all of your personal files here

64
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:17,008
in your user folder so they're all in one central location.

65
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,006
You're also free to create additional folders

66
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,002
in your user folder or within any of these default folders

67
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,000
as your needs require.

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,004
Anytime you're using an application

69
00:02:25,004 --> 00:02:27,004
and you want to save a file, for example,

70
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:29,004
if you're writing a paper and you want to save it,

71
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,003
you should navigate to your documents folder,

72
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:33,001
or into a folder you have nested inside

73
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,004
the documents folder.

74
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,009
If you're saving photos, save them to your pictures folder.

75
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:38,000
And so on.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,004
This keeps everything organized

77
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,000
and in one central location

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,007
for each individual user on the computer.

79
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,005
Notice you can quickly access these folders

80
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:47,002
from the left sidebar as well.

81
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:51,003
I can click on documents to get to my documents folder,

82
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:54,000
or music to get to my music folder.

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,002
To set up a faster way to get to your user folder,

84
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:59,009
you can click the start menu to go back to settings.

85
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:04,003
Here's like the personalization, and choose start.

86
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,001
Then click choose which folders appear on start.

87
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,009
From here you can choose which of your personal folders

88
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,005
will show up in the start menu.

89
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:13,001
So if you often need to open the document folder,

90
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,007
you can make sure documents is enabled here.

91
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:18,002
But I actually prefer to enable the personal folder,

92
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:20,008
which is another name for your user folder.

93
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:25,003
So if I close this now, when I click the start menu,

94
00:03:25,003 --> 00:03:27,007
notice we can now find personal folder.

95
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,007
And that way I can get to all of my folders quickly

96
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:32,004
without cluttering up my start menu too much.

97
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,004
So that's your user folder in Windows.

98
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,007
Again I highly recommend that you store and organize

99
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,007
all of your personal files and other media in this location.
