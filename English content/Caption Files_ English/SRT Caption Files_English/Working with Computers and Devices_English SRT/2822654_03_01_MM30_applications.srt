1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,006
- Applications are the programs that your computer runs

2
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:05,003
and in which you'll spend most of your time

3
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:06,008
on your computer.

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:09,002
Generally, an application is any piece of software

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,000
used to accomplish a task,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
whether that task is writing a paper,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
composing music, editing a digital photo,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,002
playing a video game, browsing the web,

9
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:19,008
or checking your email.

10
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,009
There are countless applications for countless purposes.

11
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,004
Some applications come pre-installed on your computer,

12
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,002
like the web browser, Microsoft Edge,

13
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:29,008
and the basic word processor, Word Pad.

14
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,005
And you can acquire and use other apps

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,009
by downloading and installing them

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,006
from software company's websites,

17
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:37,002
or through services like the Microsoft Store.

18
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,004
The same goes for the apps you use on mobile devices,

19
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,006
like your phone.

20
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:43,003
Often mobile apps are specialized for use on the go,

21
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:45,006
like navigation apps that help you find directions

22
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,009
to different locations,

23
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,004
or time management apps that send you notifications

24
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,000
reminding you of meetings and appointments.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can get almost any kind of app on your mobile device.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
For the most part, mobile apps are simpler and less powerful

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,001
than desktop apps,

28
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:01,005
which are apps designed to run on desktop computers,

29
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:03,004
as well as laptop computers.

30
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:06,004
Desktops and laptops are more powerful than mobile devices

31
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:08,004
and offer more screen space to work.

32
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:09,009
So they're more suited for running apps

33
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,004
with more features and complexity.

34
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,009
However, you'll find that app developers make both desktop

35
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,007
and mobile versions of their applications

36
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:18,007
and they often work well together.

37
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,005
For example, you could start drafting a document

38
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,009
in Microsoft Word on your phone

39
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:23,004
while you're commuting on a train

40
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:24,008
and then continue working on it

41
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:28,000
from the desktop version of word when you arrive home.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,001
These days with so many apps available,

43
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,002
you can find lots of apps

44
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:33,005
for both desktop and mobile devices

45
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,001
that are designed to help you accomplish specific tasks

46
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,000
and get work done.
