00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,002
- [Instructor] Modern computer operating systems

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,009
are designed with the needs of everyone in mind.

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,007
For example, there's a wide range of tools

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,003
and accessibility features built into Windows 10

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,003
that make it easier to use your computer

6
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:14,004
if you have certain disabilities or challenges.

7
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,000
These features often need to be enabled

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,001
before you can take advantage of them.

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,005
Many of the Windows 10 accessibility features can be found

10
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:24,007
by going to the start menu, to Settings,

11
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,005
and here click Ease of Access.

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:29,008
In the left column, you'll find accessibility categories

13
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,007
to access settings for vision, hearing, and interaction.

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,007
For example, under Vision, we can select Display,

15
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,003
and here you can change the size of the text

16
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,002
in applications you're viewing.

17
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:42,004
The slider here under Make text bigger

18
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:45,003
lets you customize the default size of text.

19
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,004
When it looks good to you, you can click Apply,

20
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,005
and you can see that instantly makes all the text,

21
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:53,004
including the text in the Setting window, larger.

22
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,002
I'm going to set that back.

23
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,002
If you need to make not just text larger,

24
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,003
but the windows and other elements as well,

25
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,009
you can select a percentage value here

26
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,004
under Make everything bigger.

27
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,008
You can see mine's currently set to 200%.

28
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:08,000
If I restore the window here so we can see some

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,005
of the elements like the Recycle Bin here,

30
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:16,004
I can make it larger or even smaller.

31
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:21,009
I'm going to set that back to the 200% setting where it was.

32
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:23,005
And below that under Make everything brighter,

33
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:26,001
you can change the brightness of your display.

34
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,002
Moving to Cursor & pointer size,

35
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,000
here you can make adjustments like increasing the size

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,008
of the mouse cursor to make it easier to see.

37
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:37,000
Notice as I click these, the size changes.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,002
And you can also change its color.

39
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,007
Above that, you can change the thickness of text cursors

40
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:46,001
so they're easier to see when you're typing.

41
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:48,002
Next, we have the magnifier.

42
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:50,005
Enabling the magnifier zooms you into the screen

43
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:54,008
at the selected size, currently set to 200% here.

44
00:01:54,008 --> 00:01:57,002
And that can make things easier to see or read.

45
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:59,006
And you can just move your mouse around the screen

46
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,005
to see other parts of the display.

47
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,005
Turn that off again for now.

48
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,004
So those are some of the useful vision settings.

49
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,000
Under Hearing, you can select Audio,

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,004
and here you can set alerts where you'll be alerted visually

51
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:13,003
so you don't miss audible alerts.

52
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:15,009
So for example, I could choose Flash the active window

53
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,000
so when an application I'm using beeps,

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,008
the window I'm currently using will also flash.

55
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,007
Under the Interaction category,

56
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,006
there are several settings based on your interaction

57
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,002
with input devices, like the keyboard, mouse,

58
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,000
speech, and eye control.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,003
Under Keyboard, for example,

60
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:33,003
there's an option to use an onscreen keyboard

61
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,009
which we can enable.

62
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:37,004
This is useful on devices without a physical keyboard,

63
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:39,003
but also for anyone who might have difficulties

64
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:42,002
using a physical keyboard and can better control the mouse

65
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,007
to input text with this virtual keyboard.

66
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,005
So this has been just a few examples

67
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,001
of the many features found in Windows

68
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,002
and other operating systems that improve accessibility

69
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,008
and allow you to use your computer more effectively.
