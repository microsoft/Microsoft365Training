00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Narrator] An important part of making sure your computer

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,007
and its programs continue to run smoothly

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:07,002
is to periodically check for and install updates

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,009
to your operating system.

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,004
For example, both Microsoft and Apple

6
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:13,002
frequently release updates to their Windows

7
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,000
and Mac OS operating systems,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,003
often fixing bugs and adding new features.

9
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:20,000
To check for updates in Windows 10,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,005
go to the start menu,

11
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:27,007
to settings, and select update and security.

12
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,006
Make sure Windows update is selected

13
00:00:29,006 --> 00:00:32,000
and then click check for updates.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,007
As long as you're connected to the internet,

15
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:37,005
Windows will check for system and security-related updates.

16
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,006
If any updates are available,

17
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:40,006
you'll see the progress of them being downloaded

18
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,004
and you'll have the option to install them,

19
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,005
which often involves restarting your computer.

20
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:45,007
So it's a good idea to make sure you're not working

21
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,008
in other applications or on any projects

22
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,009
when you're checking for and installing updates.

23
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,002
You can see I currently see this message

24
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:53,006
saying that I'm up to date,

25
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:56,008
meaning there are no system or security updates available,

26
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,006
but notice there is a feature update available

27
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,001
to my version of Windows 10.

28
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,004
And if I'm ready to install that,

29
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:06,002
I can click download and install now to begin that process.

30
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:07,008
And you can see now we'll go through the process

31
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,008
of updating Windows.

32
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:11,008
But again, if you don't see any available updates,

33
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:14,002
it means your computer is already up to date.

34
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:16,003
But you can still check back here periodically

35
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,006
to see if any updates have been released.

36
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,005
Again, it's a good idea to install updates

37
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:23,001
to make sure your computer continues to run smoothly.
