00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Instructor] One of the advantages of using

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:04,008
a suite of applications that are designed to work together

3
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,006
is that you'll find similar features and layouts

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,000
within them, making it easier to get your bearings

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,007
and to find the features you want to use.

6
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,009
For example, in the office suite of applications,

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,001
which includes programs like Microsoft Word, Excel,

8
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,002
and PowerPoint, all of which I have opened here,

9
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,008
you can see how similar they look,

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:24,001
especially in this area have tabs at the top of each window

11
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,004
called the ribbon.

12
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,005
Notice that at least the first three tabs in each app

13
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:28,007
are labeled the same.

14
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:31,000
We have file, home and insert.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,007
Both Word and PowerPoint have the Design tab next,

16
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,006
but the layout and the way the ribbon works in each app

17
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:36,009
is very similar.

18
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:38,009
I'll expand Word for a moment here.

19
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:41,004
Each tab gives you access to lots of tools and features.

20
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,009
Under the Home tab in Word,

21
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,005
you'll find the cut copy and paste commands,

22
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,007
as well as the tools for changing the font size

23
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,005
or color of text.

24
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,003
And we'll find those same options in PowerPoint and Excel.

25
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:54,009
Here's cut, copy and paste.

26
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:56,005
And here's where we can change the font,

27
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:58,005
the color and size of text.

28
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,001
So again, if you know where these features are

29
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,004
in one Office app, you'll be able to easily find them

30
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:03,009
in other Office apps.

31
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,008
Now, of course, because these are three different apps

32
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:08,006
with different purposes, you'll find other specialized tools

33
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:11,008
and features under the other tabs specific to those apps.

34
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:14,009
But they're all organized logically into the tab categories.

35
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,009
For example, in Excel, there's a Formulas tab,

36
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,005
where you can apply functions to your spreadsheets

37
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:22,007
to automatically calculate the values in certain fields,

38
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:26,008
or in PowerPoint, there's an Animations tab

39
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,003
to apply animated transitions

40
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:30,004
between the slides in your presentations.

41
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,003
Another consistent feature of the ribbon across

42
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:35,007
the Office applications is the ability to collapse it.

43
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,007
Just double click any tab to collapse the ribbon.

44
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:41,004
And that frees up more space to work with your documents.

45
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:44,002
Click any tab to temporarily reveal its contents.

46
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:46,008
And when you click away, it will collapse again.

47
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:50,006
To bring the ribbon back, just double click any tab again.

48
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:52,003
So once more when working in Office,

49
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:53,009
you should be able to find your way around

50
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,006
and locate the tools and features you need

51
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:56,009
by exploring the ribbon.

52
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,000
And as you get more familiar with its layout,

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,004
you'll be able to work more efficiently

54
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,000
in other Office apps as well.
