00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] One of the advantages of working

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,008
with spreadsheet programs like Excel

3
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:05,002
is that they can quickly perform

4
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,003
both simple and complex calculations

5
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,006
once you've set them up to do so.

6
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:10,007
Here I have a basic spreadsheet

7
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:12,000
that I've been working on to figure out

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,004
which of two jobs will give me the higher annual income.

9
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,007
I've entered the data for the hourly wage of both jobs,

10
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,008
as well as the number of hours that are available each week.

11
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,005
Now I could get out a calculator and figure out

12
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,009
what my annual income for both jobs would be,

13
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,004
but it's worth entering the proper formulas into Excel,

14
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:30,007
so if the terms of the hourly wage or hours per week change,

15
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:34,002
I just have to plug in the new numbers to update my totals.

16
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:37,001
So to add a formula to a cell, first select the cell.

17
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,006
I'll select the annual income cell for job A,

18
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,002
and then click the formulas tab.

19
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:45,002
Next, I'm going to click the arrow below the autosome button,

20
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,004
which gives me a list of common calculations,

21
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,003
but I need a formula other than what's listed here,

22
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,000
so I'll choose more functions.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,001
That opens up the function window.

24
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:55,007
So to figure out the annual income,

25
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:59,004
I need to multiply my hourly wage by my hours per week,

26
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,003
and then multiply that number by the number of weeks

27
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll be working in a year.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,005
Multiplication is a basic math function.

29
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:08,003
So I'll choose the category of math and trig,

30
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,003
and then under select the function,

31
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,009
I'll find and double click product.

32
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,000
Now it's just a matter of building my formula

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
by specifying which cells need to get multiplied together.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,008
In this case Excel is actually smart enough

35
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,004
to have already guessed that I want to multiply

36
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:26,002
the value in cell B3 by the value in cell B4.

37
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,003
Now, if it didn't guess correctly,

38
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,004
I would just need to click the cell

39
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,005
I want to grab the data from,

40
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:31,009
or I can drag across multiple cells

41
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,002
if there are more than one,

42
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:34,006
but in this case it did guess correctly,

43
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:37,007
so I'll drag across B3 and B4 again.

44
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,004
All right, so now we need to multiply the product

45
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:42,000
of B3 and B4 by the number of weeks in a year,

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,001
which is 52.

47
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,002
So I add that in number two field.

48
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:48,008
I'll click okay to close out the formula,

49
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,008
and just like that the calculation is performed,

50
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:53,004
and I see the annual income for job A.

51
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,004
Now a really nice thing about most spreadsheet programs

52
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,007
is that if you want to perform the same calculation

53
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:59,000
on another set of numbers,

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,004
you don't have to build the whole formula

55
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,007
from scratch again.

56
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:04,006
I'm just going to select the annual income for job A,

57
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:07,008
and then click copy under the home tab.

58
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,007
You can also use Control C.

59
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:12,002
Then I'll select the annual income cell for job B,

60
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,006
and click paste.

61
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,002
So it's that easy.

62
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,008
Notice in the formula builder

63
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,002
that Excel was smart enough to swap out B3 and B4

64
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:22,007
for C3 and C4.

65
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:24,002
Now I can plainly see that job B

66
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,009
will earn me more money even though it's fewer hours.

67
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,005
And if any of this data changes,

68
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:32,003
maybe job B is reduced to 35 hours per week,

69
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,009
I can just type that in,

70
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:36,000
and my total is updated instantly.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,001
Lastly, I should probably format

72
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,001
the annual income cells as currency.

73
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,003
So I'll select them.

74
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:43,005
And here in the numbers section of the home tab,

75
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,003
I'll set these to currency.

76
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:47,000
So that's the basics of entering data

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,006
into an Excel worksheet and performing calculations.
