- [Instructor] Creating strong passwords

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,006
is vitally important to maintaining the security

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,001
of your account on your computer,

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,007
and also for keeping yourself safe online.

5
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,006
If your password is easily guessed,

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:13,003
all of your documents, photos, and other files

7
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,004
could potentially be viewed

8
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,009
by anyone with access to your computer.

9
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,001
When you first create an account on your operating system,

10
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,008
or when an account is created for you

11
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,009
by someone administering your computer,

12
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:25,009
a password is created for you to access your account.

13
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,009
You can change your password at any time,

14
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:29,000
which you may want to do if you feel

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,007
your password isn't strong enough,

16
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,004
or that someone may have guessed your password.

17
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:36,002
But what exactly makes for a strong password?

18
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:39,003
Conventional wisdom often suggests these guidelines.

19
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:41,009
Your password should be at least eight characters in length.

20
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:44,006
Short passwords are easier to guess.

21
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:48,000
It should be a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,009
There should be at least one capital letter,

23
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,008
and you'll want to avoid making it the first letter,

24
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,009
as that's a pretty common practice.

25
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,005
You also want to have at least one number

26
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,005
and at least one symbol.

27
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:59,009
Exclamation points and hashtags are pretty common, though,

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,006
so try lesser-used symbols

29
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:05,000
like the greater or lesser than symbol or a comma.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,004
Also avoid using dates, numbers, or names

31
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:10,002
people know or can find out are associated with you,

32
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,004
at least as the only part of the password.

33
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,005
So don't use your birth date or your dog's name

34
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,002
or your maiden name, for example.

35
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:19,009
Lastly, avoid writing down your password on paper.

36
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,001
If you have to write it down,

37
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,003
keep it physically secure or locked away,

38
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,009
and not just sitting next to your computer.

39
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:26,007
Now with that said,

40
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:29,003
how do you create a secure password that you can remember?

41
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,001
There are different schools of thought on this.

42
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:33,001
One suggestion is to think of a short phrase

43
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,003
that has meaning to you, but not a direct connection.

44
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:39,004
For example, "four score and seven years ago".

45
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:45,004
To make that into a password, I could change it to 4s&7Ya.

46
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,009
So in this case, the 4 represents four,

47
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,003
the lowercase S stands for score,

48
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:53,002
the ampersand stands for the and, which also has the benefit

49
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,002
of being a less commonly used symbol,

50
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:58,004
the 7 for the seven, the Y for the year,

51
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:00,002
which I capitalized in this case,

52
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,003
and the A for ago.

53
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,009
So this is a fairly secure password with a key phrase

54
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,005
that you can keep in your head without writing it down.

55
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,006
Now, it doesn't have at least eight characters,

56
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,008
so I might add some symbols I'll easily remember

57
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,007
before and after the phrase.

58
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,004
Now, alternately, you can think of your password

59
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,008
as a pass phrase, and come up with a sentence

60
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:20,002
comprised of at least four to five words.

61
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:24,008
For example, MyDogMaxIsSuperKeen!

62
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:29,009
Or BiscottiGoesGreatWithCaramelCoffee!!

63
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,004
Even though both of those examples go against the suggestion

64
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:35,004
of not using exclamation points as your special character,

65
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:37,003
and neither of them include numbers,

66
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,009
they're both long enough that they'd be

67
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,007
very difficult for someone to guess,

68
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,005
unless they're phrases you often say out loud.

69
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:45,001
Now, a powerful computer might be able

70
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,005
to guess these passwords given enough time,

71
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,008
but most systems lock you out

72
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:51,005
after you exceed a reasonable number of password attempts,

73
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,007
usually around 10 attempts.

74
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,008
So passwords should be complex,

75
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,001
but they also need to be memorable

76
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:58,007
so you can enter them relatively easy

77
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,003
when you need to log in.

78
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,002
Be sure to take some time

79
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,000
to develop your own strong password

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,002
for your login information on your computer.
