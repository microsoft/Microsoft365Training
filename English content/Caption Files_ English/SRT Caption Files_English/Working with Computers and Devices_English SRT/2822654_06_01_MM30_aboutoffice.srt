1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,003
- If you often have to move between different types of tasks

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,008
for work like writing documents, creating spreadsheets,

3
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:10,001
putting together presentations, and handling your calendar,

4
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,004
you could do all of these things

5
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:12,009
with several individual apps

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,001
from multiple software developers,

7
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,001
but it often makes more sense to work with apps

8
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,001
that have been designed to work together,

9
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:22,000
giving you the ability to move seamlessly between them.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,006
Microsoft Office, for example,

11
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,009
is a collection of applications designed to work

12
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:28,005
in conjunction with each other to make it easier for you

13
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,000
to accomplish tasks and get things done.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,005
Office includes applications like Word for word processing,

15
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,007
Excel for working with spreadsheets,

16
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:40,001
and PowerPoint for creating slideshow presentations.

17
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,003
There are versions of Office available for Windows

18
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,006
and Mac operating systems, mobile operating systems,

19
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:48,000
as well as an online version that can be accessed

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,003
from any computer's web browsing application,

21
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:54,001
regardless of the operating system it's running.

22
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,006
It's a good idea to explore different software suites

23
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,003
to find the one that will be best suited

24
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:00,003
for the type of work you do.

25
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,005
Other software packages similar to Office

26
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,004
include Apple's iWork suite,

27
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,006
which includes Pages, Numbers, and Keynote

28
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:10,000
for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,003
If you're a Mac user, you may want to consider these apps

30
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:15,008
since they're included for free on all macOS computers.

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,002
Similarly, Google's online G Suite is also free

32
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:22,003
for consumers and includes apps like Google Docs, Sheets,

33
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,003
and Slides to create your documents,

34
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,005
spreadsheets, and presentations.

35
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,009
So be sure to look at these and other alternatives

36
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,003
when deciding which software to use.

37
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,009
In this course, we'll be focusing on Microsoft Office

38
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,001
as it's the most widely used

39
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,001
of these productivity suites of applications.

40
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,007
There are two main versions of Microsoft Office available,

41
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:45,001
currently named Microsoft 365 and Office 2019.

42
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,007
Microsoft 365 is a subscription-based version

43
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,003
of the suite of applications.

44
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,007
There are multiple subscription plans

45
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:55,004
like Microsoft 365 Personal, Microsoft 365 Home & Student,

46
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:59,004
and Microsoft 365 Business Premium, among others.

47
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,008
The cost of the subscription depends

48
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,002
on which plan you choose,

49
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,005
and the apps contained in each version can vary,

50
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:07,000
although they all contain the most popular applications,

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,007
including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

52
00:02:10,007 --> 00:02:13,002
With your subscription, you can install the software

53
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:15,007
on up to five Windows machines or Macs,

54
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,007
five tablet devices, and five mobile devices,

55
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:20,007
which is convenient if others in your household need

56
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,009
to use the software too.

57
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,006
Your subscription also includes the many software updates

58
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,003
that Microsoft regularly releases

59
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:29,004
for the suite of applications.

60
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,000
These updates can include bug fixes

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,006
as well as new features and abilities.

62
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:36,004
As long as you pay your monthly or annual subscription fees,

63
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,009
you'll continue to have access to the latest versions

64
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:42,005
of all the applications included in your plan.

65
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:46,000
Office 2019, on the other hand, is a one-time purchase.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,009
Unlike Microsoft 365, you pay a single price

67
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:52,000
for access to all the applications in Office 2019,

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
with no future fees or charges.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,001
The software is yours to use indefinitely.

70
00:02:57,001 --> 00:02:59,003
You need to keep in mind that your purchase only allows you

71
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:01,004
to install the software on a single computer

72
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:04,006
rather than multiple computers and mobile devices.

73
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:06,006
You also don't get access to any new features

74
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:09,002
or other updates with Office 2019.

75
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,002
So if you want to update to a new version months

76
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,002
or years later,

77
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:15,000
you'll have to pay for that new version as well.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,002
So which version you choose depends a lot

79
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:19,004
on how much you'll be using the Office applications

80
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:21,003
and if having access to the latest versions

81
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:23,005
of the software is important to you.

82
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:26,005
For example, if you need the ability to work across devices,

83
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,007
like if you want to be able to work on an Excel spreadsheet

84
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,001
on your phone during a commute

85
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,003
and later pick up where you left off on that spreadsheet

86
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,005
from your desktop computer or tablet,

87
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,007
you'll want to go with Microsoft 365.

88
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:40,002
On the other hand, if you know you need Word, Excel,

89
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,009
or PowerPoint, but you use them infrequently enough

90
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,001
that you don't need the latest versions or features

91
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,007
or to work on your files between multiple devices,

92
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,008
Office 2019 is probably better suited for you.

93
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:53,006
Lastly, if your use of Office products is very infrequent,

94
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:55,003
you can access free versions of most

95
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:58,008
of the Office applications online at office.com.

96
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:01,001
These are lightweight versions of the Office products,

97
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,006
but they have a lot of the functionality

98
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,005
of their full-featured counterparts.

99
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:06,008
And again, you can check them out for free at office.com

100
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:08,005
to see if they'll work for you.

101
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:09,008
Otherwise, you can find out more

102
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:13,006
about the various Office packages at microsoft365.com.
