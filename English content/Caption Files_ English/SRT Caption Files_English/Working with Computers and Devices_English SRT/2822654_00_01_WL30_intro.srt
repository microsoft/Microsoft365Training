or even dread when you've sat down in front of a computer,

00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,008
We're going to avoid technical jargon

26
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:03,008
and discuss everything in easy to understand terms,

27
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,003
all while building your knowledge level

28
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:08,002
