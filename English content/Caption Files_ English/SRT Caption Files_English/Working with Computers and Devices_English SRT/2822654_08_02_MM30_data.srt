00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,005
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at how to create

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:03,007
a basic spreadsheet from scratch.

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:04,009
At its most basic level,

4
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,001
a spreadsheet is the digital equivalent

5
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,000
of a paper ledger sheet.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,008
Like ledgers, spreadsheets are comprised of a grid of rows

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,006
and columns and can be used for balancing your checkbook,

8
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,000
calculating loans, managing the address

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and contact information of customers, and so on.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,001
One of the advantages of spreadsheet programs

11
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,007
is that they can quickly perform complex calculations

12
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:26,008
once you've set them up to do so.

13
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,004
I'll start by creating a new blank workbook,

14
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:32,003
and I'll make that a little larger so we can see it better.

15
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,005
Let's say I'm trying to decide between taking two jobs

16
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,007
at an hourly rate.

17
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,000
One pays more per hour

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,003
but offers slightly fewer hours than the one that pays less.

19
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,001
I'll start by using the first row of columns, B and C,

20
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,006
as the headers for the two job calculations.

21
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,009
To type into a cell, we just click it.

22
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:50,005
I'll type Job A into B1.

23
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:52,002
To move horizontally from cell to cell,

24
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:54,005
you can press the Tab key on your keyboard.

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:55,004
You can go back to the left

26
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,004
by holding Shift as you press Tab.

27
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:59,005
But in this case, I do want to type into cell C1,

28
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,009
so I'll press Tab again,

29
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,007
and I'll label this Job B.

30
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,006
And I'll use column A to label all the rows

31
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:09,002
I'm going to need, starting with Hourly Wage.

32
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, pressing Enter or Return on your keyboard

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,008
let's you move down a single column.

34
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:15,004
Holding Shift while pressing Return moves you back up.

35
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:17,005
But in this case, I want to go down.

36
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,003
And I'll quickly add two more rows of labels

37
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:24,002
for Hours per week and Annual Income.

38
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,000
Now, column A isn't quite wide enough

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,005
for the text that I've typed.

40
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:30,003
So I'll place my mouse cursor between columns A and B.

41
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:31,003
When I see this vertical line

42
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:32,007
with two arrows pointing either way,

43
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,005
I can click and drag to the right

44
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,006
to make column A a little wider.

45
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:39,002
Okay, so, so far we've added labels to these cells.

46
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:41,002
Cells containing only text and no numbers

47
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,008
are generally referred to as labels.

48
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:46,005
Next, I'm going to add the data that I know about each job,

49
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,005
starting with the Hourly Wage.

50
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:52,008
Let's say the hourly wage for job A is 1475.

51
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:55,005
I'll press Tab to enter it and move to the next cell.

52
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:59,007
And let's make job B's hourly wage 1585.

53
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:01,007
So that's the basics of creating a spreadsheet

54
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,002
and entering data into it.

55
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,007
Now, there's a lot more we can do here,

56
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,008
like formatting the cells

57
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:07,006
to only accept certain types of data.

58
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,000
For example, I could set up the sheet

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,005
so only numbers could be entered into the job columns,

60
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,009
and we can also add formulas to automatically calculate

61
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,006
the wages based on the number of available hours.

62
00:02:16,006 --> 00:02:18,009
But it all starts with first entering some basic content

63
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:21,001
into your spreadsheet like we've done here.
