1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,006
- These days the term computer can refer

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,008
to many different types of devices.

3
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:08,003
We have desktop computers, laptop or notebook computers

4
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,005
and mobile devices like tablets and phones

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,004
are even considered computers.

6
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:15,006
At the most basic level, a computer is an electronic device

7
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:19,000
that you use to create, process, store, or retrieve

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,004
different types of data and information.

9
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,007
For example, you might create a word processing document

10
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:26,004
on a desktop computer or browse the internet

11
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:30,003
on a tablet device, or email photos from your mobile phone.

12
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,004
All computers consist of two main parts,

13
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,004
hardware and software.

14
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:37,003
Software refers to the programs that run on the computer.

15
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,007
Basically software programs are the parts of the computer

16
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,002
you can't physically touch,

17
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,004
like a word processing application, an email program

18
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:47,008
and even the computer's operating system is software.

19
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:49,009
Most computers come with built in software

20
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,000
and you can install a virtually unlimited number

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,001
of other software programs that you might want

22
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,003
or need to use on your computer.

23
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,005
Now, hardware refers to all the physical parts

24
00:00:58,005 --> 00:00:59,009
that make up a computer.

25
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,008
For example, on a desktop computer,

26
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,000
you have the main unit that contains the central parts

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,001
like the CPU, the RAM or memory, and the hard drive.

28
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,009
With desktop computers, you also need an external monitor,

29
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,002
also called a display and devices for inputting information

30
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:16,004
like a keyboard and a mouse.

31
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:19,005
On computers like laptops, tablets, or mobile devices,

32
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,006
the display is built into the device

33
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,000
and they all generally have built in keyboards

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
or, as is the case with many tablets and mobile devices,

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,009
the keyboard appears on screen when needed.

36
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,000
Computer hardware can also refer to any number

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,001
of accessories you can connect to the computer

38
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:37,001
such as printers, scanners, speakers, and so on,

39
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,009
which give additional functionality to the computer.

40
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,004
So again, when we talk about computers

41
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,009
at the most basic level,

42
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,002
we're talking about an electronic machine comprised of

43
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:46,007
various pieces of hardware

44
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,003
on which you can operate various pieces of software.
