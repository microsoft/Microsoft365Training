00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,007
- [Instructor] Office Online is a free version of Office

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,006
that you can access from your web browser,

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:07,005
regardless of the operating system you're using.

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:10,003
In your browser, navigate to Office.com,

5
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:12,008
and click Sign in.

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:14,001
Using Office Online requires you

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,009
to have a free Microsoft account.

8
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,004
If you don't yet have an account,

9
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:19,003
you can click the Create one option

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,001
to create an account right away,

11
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,006
and use any existing email address you have.

12
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,008
Just be aware that it has to be a personal email address

13
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,007
and not one associated with your work or school.

14
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,008
But if you already have an account,

15
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,003
you can enter your username and password.

16
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:34,003
After signing in,

17
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:36,005
you'll see this screen where you can access all of the apps

18
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,008
that make up the Office Online package.

19
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,000
These online versions don't have all the same features

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,004
as the desktop versions,

21
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:45,000
but you can still accomplish a lot online.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,005
For example, to use Microsoft Word, click its icon,

23
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,002
and that launches Word.

24
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:51,009
From here, you can choose to create a new document

25
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,004
from scratch by clicking New blank document,

26
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:55,008
or you can use any of the other templates

27
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:57,005
to start working from.

28
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,001
You can open an existing file from your OneDrive account,

29
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,004
which is Microsoft's cloud-based storage service,

30
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:03,006
where you can store and work with files

31
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,003
in all of the Office apps.

32
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,005
Saving your files to OneDrive

33
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,007
from Office Online allows you to continue working

34
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:12,002
on those files in the desktop versions of the apps later.

35
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:13,006
To work in any other app,

36
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,006
click the launcher button here

37
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,003
in the upper left-hand corner,

38
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:19,000
and select the app you want to use.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,001
So now I've opened Excel Online,

40
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,005
and I can create a new blank workbook

41
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,008
to start working in an Excel spreadsheet.

42
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:28,005
Again, Office Online is free and offers a convenient way

43
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,003
to access your files and documents from various devices

44
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:32,005
and while on the go.
