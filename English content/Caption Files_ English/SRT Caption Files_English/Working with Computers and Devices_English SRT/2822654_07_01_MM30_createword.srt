1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,003
- The first step to working in Microsoft Word is

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,000
to open an existing document

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,003
or to create a brand-new document.

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:08,007
If you're creating a new document,

5
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,007
you can start from scratch with a completely blank document

6
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,008
or use one of the many available templates included

7
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:15,007
with Office to create documents

8
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:20,000
like resumes, flyers, reports, and more.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,009
To create a new document, open up Word.

10
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:24,008
And from here, we can select Blank document

11
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,005
to instantly create a new empty Word document.

12
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:30,007
And you can start typing.

13
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,001
Or to create a new document based on a template,

14
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,005
from here, you can go to File, select New,

15
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,002
and below the Blank document option,

16
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,008
you'll find a large collection of templates to choose from.

17
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:43,000
You can scroll through to browse the templates

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,001
or scroll back up and type a search term

19
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,009
to look for online templates.

20
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:48,007
I'll search for newsletter.

21
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,004
That gives me several results.

22
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,008
Click any template to get a closer look

23
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,003
and to read a description.

24
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,001
And when you find a template you'd like to use,

25
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,000
click Create.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,005
That generates a new document based on that template,

27
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,004
and you can start replacing the placeholder text

28
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:05,000
and images with your own.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,003
Once you add text and other content to your document,

30
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,005
you should save the document,

31
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,002
so you don't lose your changes.

32
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:13,002
One way to do this is to click File

33
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:14,008
and Save As.

34
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,008
Then choose a location to save the file.

35
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,005
If you have a OneDrive account set up,

36
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:20,000
you can save to your OneDrive folder

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,006
to save your document to the cloud,

38
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:22,007
so you'll be able to access it

39
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:25,002
from anywhere on any device running Word.

40
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,006
Or you can choose to save it locally

41
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:30,003
to the computer you're currently using by choosing Browse.

42
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,000
Navigate to the location on your computer

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,009
where you want to save your file.

44
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,001
I'll choose my Documents folder.

45
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,009
Then name your file.

46
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:42,008
I'll call this AugustNewsletter, and I'll click Save.

47
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:45,001
And now this is saved to my Documents folder.

48
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,000
I can check that by going to the Start menu

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,006
and selecting Documents from here

50
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,008
to jump to my Documents folder,

51
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:53,005
and there's my newsletter.

52
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,005
And now I can close this

53
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:57,008
and continue working on my newsletter here in Word.

54
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,001
As you work, it's a good idea to periodically save your file

55
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,002
to make sure you don't lose your changes.

56
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,001
Once you've saved your file the first time,

57
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,005
you can quickly save it again by clicking the Save button

58
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,002
at the top of the Word window.

59
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,009
So that's how to create a new document,

60
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,008
start editing it, and how to save it.
