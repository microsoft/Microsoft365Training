1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] In addition to using Word

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:03,009
on your desktop or laptop computer,

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:05,008
you can also install the mobile version of Word

4
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:09,002
on your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:12,001
This gives you the ability to access and edit your documents

6
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,001
and stay productive from virtually anywhere.

7
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,005
Just go to the app store on your mobile device.

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,006
If you're on an Apple iPhone or iPad,

9
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,008
you'll open up the app store app.

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,002
If you're using an Android device,

11
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,004
open the Google Play store app.

12
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,007
Then do a search for Word,

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:30,003
select it, and from here, you can download

14
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,002
and install it on your device for free.

15
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:35,006
So here you see Word on my iPad.

16
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,003
Be aware that Word may look a little different

17
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,000
depending on the device you're using,

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,008
but the functionality is nearly identical

19
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:43,003
across all mobile devices.

20
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,007
For a specific details, you can visit support.office.com

21
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,009
in your web browser, and search for your device

22
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:52,000
by typing something like Word for iPad,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,003
and you'll see a list of results.

24
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,002
So to use Word on your mobile device,

25
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,004
signing with the same account

26
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,008
you use for Office on your desktop or laptop computer.

27
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:03,000
Be aware that to access basic features of Word,

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,009
you don't need an Office subscription,

29
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:07,001
but a subscription doesn't lock all of the editing features

30
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,003
of Word on your mobile device.

31
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,006
And once I'm signed in, I can use Word anytime.

32
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:13,003
I need to start a new document,

33
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,007
or work on an existing one without having to wait

34
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,008
to get back to my computer at home or at the office,

35
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:19,007
I'll create a new document

36
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,004
by clicking the blank document template.

37
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:25,004
And now I can start typing.

38
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,009
Now, in this case, I'm typing with the onscreen keyboard,

39
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,002
but if you have an external keyboard

40
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,006
connected to your mobile device,

41
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,007
you can use that to allow for more visible area

42
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,006
for your document on screen.

43
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,007
You can then format the text

44
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,001
just like you can in the desktop version of Word.

45
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,006
For instance, I could select this heading,

46
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:44,000
and then go to the styles menu, and apply heading one.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,003
Now you can see the top of the screen.

48
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:48,001
My document currently has the default name of document.

49
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,006
I want to give it a more descriptive name

50
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,009
so I know what this document contains later.

51
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,000
So I'd have the file icon here

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,004
in the upper left hand corner and tap save.

53
00:01:56,004 --> 00:02:00,001
And I'll rename this to give any more descriptive name.

54
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,000
This is also where I can choose the location

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,006
to save the file. If I want to be able to access it later

56
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:06,004
from another device or a computer,

57
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,000
I could save it to my OneDrive account online.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,002
Or alternately, if you know you won't have wifi

59
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,003
or internet access available as you're working,

60
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:16,000
you can save the file to your device instead of OneDrive,

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,008
so you can continue working on it while you're not online.

62
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,003
You can always save it to OneDrive later,

63
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:21,004
or to another location

64
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:23,006
once you've connected to the internet again.

65
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,005
In this case, I'll just choose to save it on my iPad,

66
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:28,003
and I'll tap save.

67
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:30,008
And now I can continue working on my document.

68
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:33,006
As you work, Word saves your changes automatically,

69
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,004
so you don't have to worry about remembering to save

70
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:39,001
as frequently as you may have to using the desktop version.

71
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,008
So with the mobile version of Word,

72
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,004
you have the freedom to work anywhere

73
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:44,002
and capture your ideas in writing.
