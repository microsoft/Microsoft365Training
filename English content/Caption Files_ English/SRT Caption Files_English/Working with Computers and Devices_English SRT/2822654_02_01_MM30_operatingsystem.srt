1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,005
- You've probably heard the term operating system before,

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,007
but you might not be exactly sure what it means.

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,003
- Essentially, your computer's operating system

4
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,005
is the software that manages how you interact

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,006
with the computer, how the programs on the computer

6
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:15,002
use and access the computer's hardware,

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:18,006
and is a big part of how your computer behaves and performs.

8
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:21,002
You can think of the operating system as the master program

9
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,006
that runs and manages all the other programs

10
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,004
on your computer.

11
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,009
It's the backbone of your computer

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:29,002
and the most important program, because it controls

13
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:30,005
everything that goes in and out

14
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,001
of your computer, from allocating memory to programs,

15
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,006
to copying files from one drive to another,

16
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,000
to receiving commands from your keyboard and mouse,

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,006
to telling you the time of day.

18
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:43,001
You can't have a computer without an operating system.

19
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,006
Usually the operating system comes pre-installed

20
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,004
on your computer, but if you've had your computer

21
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,008
for a few years, you may want or need to upgrade

22
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,001
your operating system to the most current version

23
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,005
that the operating systems manufacturer has released.

24
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,003
Now, with that said,

25
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:58,005
there are many different operating systems out there.

26
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:01,005
On PCs, the most popular operating system is Windows.

27
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:04,006
On Mac's the operating system is called macOS.

28
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,007
These are probably the two

29
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:08,000
most well known operating systems.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,003
You may have also heard of Linux,

31
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,008
another popular computer operating system.

32
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:13,008
And generally, any computer or device that runs programs,

33
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:18,001
especially multiple programs has an operating system.

34
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,005
Your mobile phone runs an operating system.

35
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:23,003
For example, Android devices run Android OS,

36
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:26,007
and the Apple mobile device operating system is iOS.

37
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,004
Now, in addition to the essential purpose

38
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,006
of managing your computer and the programs you use,

39
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,009
most operating systems like Windows and macOS

40
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,005
also come with built-in programs called applications.

41
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:41,001
Applications are also called apps, programs or software.

42
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,000
These can be simple word processing applications,

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
applications for managing your photos,

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,006
applications for sending and receiving emails, and so on.

45
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,007
In some cases, you can get by with the applications included

46
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:53,005
with your operating system.

47
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:56,004
For example, both Windows and macOS come with built-in

48
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:59,000
web browsing applications for browsing the web,

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,002
but you're also free to install and use applications

50
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:02,009
made by other companies.

51
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,008
Some applications can be downloaded for free

52
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,002
from the companies that make them.

53
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,008
Others have to be purchased.

54
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,003
It really depends on what application we're talking about.

55
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,009
It's also very important to note

56
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,006
that you usually have to make sure you're downloading

57
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:15,002
or purchasing the version of software

58
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,002
that's made for your operating system.

59
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,008
For example, if you're using Windows,

60
00:02:18,008 --> 00:02:20,008
you need to run Windows applications.

61
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:23,006
If you're on a Mac, you need Mac applications.

62
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,009
In many cases, software developers release both versions

63
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:29,004
of their software, but there are many applications

64
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:31,006
that only work with one or the other.

65
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,000
Whether you're downloading software

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,002
or purchasing at a store, you should always be able to find

67
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:38,003
a section called system requirements that will let you know

68
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:40,007
what operating system you need to run the software,

69
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,007
as well as the minimum amount of RAM, hard drive space,

70
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,002
and any other requirements.
