1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] Every software application

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,002
has a learning curve.

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,004
Some applications are easier to use and understand

4
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:06,003
than others,

5
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:07,003
but what you're going to find

6
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:10,001
as you become more experienced with computers and software,

7
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:12,001
is that nearly all applications have features

8
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:14,005
or controls in common with each other.

9
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:16,005
If you're a novice with computers at the moment,

10
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,007
you've probably wondered how more experienced users

11
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:20,005
can just sit down and start being productive

12
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,002
with applications they've never used before.

13
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,001
What seasoned computer users know

14
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,008
is that most applications have basic things in common,

15
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,002
and they know where to look for the commands

16
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:30,009
that will allow them to perform the tasks

17
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:32,006
they want to accomplish.

18
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,006
For example, a common feature found in many apps

19
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,002
is the File menu,

20
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,005
and it usually contains commands

21
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:40,009
like New, Open, Save, Close, and Print.

22
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:43,000
New is for creating a new document, image,

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,008
or project, depending on what app you're in.

24
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,002
Open opens files or projects

25
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:50,000
that you've previously created or worked on.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,005
Save saves the file you're currently working on.

27
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:54,004
And if the application is one that you can print from

28
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,007
like a word processor, a spreadsheet program,

29
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:57,008
or a photo editor,

30
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,001
you'll always find the print command

31
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,009
under the File menu as well.

32
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,008
Another common feature is a group of commands

33
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,007
found under the Edit menu.

34
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:06,005
This is where you'll almost always find the commands

35
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,003
for Cut, Copy, and Paste,

36
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:11,004
as well as the Undo and Redo options.

37
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,009
So for example, if you've typed some texts

38
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:13,007
that you would like to copy

39
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,007
to another location in your document,

40
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,007
you would select the text

41
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,008
by clicking and dragging across it.

42
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:23,007
Then come up to the Edit menu and choose Copy,

43
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:24,008
and then you could place your cursor

44
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:25,007
elsewhere in the document

45
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,007
or in a completely different document

46
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:31,008
and choose Edit, Paste.

47
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,007
And if you change your mind about pasting that text,

48
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:37,007
you would return to the Edit menu and choose Undo.

49
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,004
And again, these commands work the same way

50
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,008
in any apps that have them.

51
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,008
And you'll almost always find them under the Edit menu.

52
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,001
Bear in mind that this holds true

53
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,000
across operating systems, too.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,006
So if you're a Mac user finding yourself

55
00:01:48,006 --> 00:01:51,008
working with Windows or a Windows user having to use a Mac,

56
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:53,006
you won't be completely lost.

57
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,000
You'll most likely see differences

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,004
in how menus and commands have been laid out,

59
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,008
but many of the ideas are the same.

60
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:02,001
Even between applications on the same operating system

61
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,005
you'll see differences.

62
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,002
For example, if I switch over to Microsoft Excel,

63
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,005
instead of a plain menu bar,

64
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,002
we have a collection of tabs known as the ribbon.

65
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:13,000
Notice we have a File tab though, and if I click it,

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,007
I can still find New, Open, Save, Print, and so on.

67
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,004
It looks different than it does in Notepad,

68
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,004
but the commands are the same.

69
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,008
Note however, that we don't see an edit tab.

70
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,007
In this case, we have a Home tab,

71
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,004
and this is where we find buttons for Cut

72
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,003
and Copy and Paste.

73
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:29,008
And the buttons for Undo and Redo

74
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:31,009
are here at the top of the window.

75
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:33,001
So again, the layout is different,

76
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,007
but the behavior of the commands is the same.

77
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:38,002
You just may have to hunt around a bit for them.

78
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:40,001
Another feature that almost all apps have in common

79
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,007
are preference settings.

80
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,007
These are the settings that often let you customize

81
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,007
or change how the app behaves.

82
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:46,008
They may be called different things

83
00:02:46,008 --> 00:02:48,004
depending on the app you're using.

84
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:51,000
Here in Excel if I go to the File tab,

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,002
down at the bottom I'll find Options.

86
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,002
Which takes me to this large collection of settings

87
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:58,006
that I can use to adjust how Excel looks and works.

88
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,005
In other apps,

89
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,002
for example, in the Microsoft Edge web browser,

90
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,004
we click this three dot menu,

91
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,006
which gives us access to some options,

92
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:08,005
but we can also select settings

93
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:11,000
to further customize how Edge operates.

94
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,008
In other apps you'll find a preferences selection

95
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:14,002
under the Edit menu.

96
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:15,002
So you sometimes have to do

97
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:16,007
some hunting around in Windows apps,

98
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,001
but those are generally where you'll find

99
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,009
application preferences.

100
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:21,008
Lastly, you'll find almost all applications

101
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,002
have a Help menu.

102
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,006
The Help menu is where you'll find things

103
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:26,008
like the built-in or online instruction manual

104
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,007
for the application you're using.

105
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,005
You might also find links to tutorials

106
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:31,008
or other special guides

107
00:03:31,008 --> 00:03:34,003
to teach you how to use the application.

108
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:37,002
The Help menu is also where you can often check for updates,

109
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:39,001
which has the application check online

110
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:41,000
to see if any newer versions of the software

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,004
have been released.

112
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,008
Here in Edge we come up to the three dot menu again,

113
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:47,002
and this is where we can find Help and Feedback.

114
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:48,005
And if I choose Help,

115
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,001
that takes me to the Edge support website.

116
00:03:51,001 --> 00:03:54,002
Back here in Excel, there's a Help tab,

117
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:56,006
and that gives you buttons for contacting support,

118
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:58,001
showing training documents,

119
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,009
or you can click the Help button

120
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:02,001
to see instructions for using Excel.

121
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,009
But generally the help menu is a good place to go

122
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,008
if you can't figure out

123
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,008
a feature of the application you're using,

124
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:09,005
or just want to learn more about the application overall.

125
00:04:09,005 --> 00:04:11,000
And again, you'll find that most applications

126
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,005
have this menu.

127
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:14,003
So those are just some of the common features

128
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,006
you'll find in nearly all applications.

129
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,003
As you continue to work in various apps,

130
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,009
you'll notice many more.

131
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,001
And knowing about these features

132
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,007
can really help make an application you've never used before

133
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:25,000
a little less daunting,

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,008
because at least you'll already be familiar with

135
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:29,001
and know how to use a couple of the commands.
