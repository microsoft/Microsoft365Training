00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,002
- [Narrator] When creating a spreadsheet in Excel,

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,007
it can be useful to format cells

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:05,009
to only accept certain types of data,

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,001
especially if other people will be using the worksheet

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:09,007
you're creating and you want to make sure

6
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:12,005
they can't fill in any incorrect information.

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:13,003
For example,

8
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,007
I'm creating the spreadsheet here to determine

9
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,004
which of two jobs will be the most profitable for me.

10
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:19,006
I've already entered the hourly wage amounts,

11
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,006
but notice I can also select either of those cells

12
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:25,006
and enter words instead. I'll click undo.

13
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,003
Now, since there's no reason to enter anything

14
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:28,006
but numbers in these cells,

15
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:31,002
I'll format them so that's all they'll accept.

16
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:34,003
So I'll drag to select the two cells for hourly wage.

17
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:35,005
And with those cells selected,

18
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:37,007
I'm going to go to the data tab

19
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:39,008
and look at the section called data tools.

20
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:43,002
And here there's a button for data validation.

21
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,003
Under the settings tab here,

22
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:47,002
I can specify what type of input is allowed in the cell.

23
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,000
Because this is an hourly wage,

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,002
I'm going to allow decimal places.

25
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:52,009
And in order to validate a cell like this

26
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,004
that's going to accept numbers,

27
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,008
I have to specify a range of numbers.

28
00:00:56,008 --> 00:01:01,003
In this case, I'll put in a range from zero to 100

29
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,007
as I doubt I'll be making more than $100 per hour.

30
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:06,005
But I could always come back and change this if necessary.

31
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,002
I'll click OK.

32
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:10,000
So now if I try to enter anything but numbers

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,001
in either of these cells,

34
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,000
I get a message telling me that the value I entered

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
doesn't match the cell restrictions.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,004
I'll click retry,

37
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:21,006
and let's set the hourly wage to 14.75 again.

38
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,002
When I press tab, that value is accepted.

39
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,007
And I already have the value I want in this second cell.

40
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,008
But it too only accepts numbers now.

41
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,008
Now since these are both monetary values,

42
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,008
I might want to format the cells to make their contents

43
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,006
look more like dollar values.

44
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,004
I'm going to select both cells again.

45
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,009
And then under the home tab, in the number section,

46
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,007
I'm going to select currency as the kind of number

47
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:43,001
for these cells.

48
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,003
And you can see that puts a dollar sign in front of them.

49
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:49,006
If necessary, I can change the currency with this menu here.

50
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:52,002
But I'll leave this set to English United States.

51
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's quickly format the hours per week cells

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,005
in columns B and C.

53
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,003
I'll select those two cells,

54
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,003
and let's validate them as decimal numbers too,

55
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,001
just in case one of the jobs requires shift

56
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,009
in half or quarter hour increments.

57
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,005
Again, I'll go back to the data tab.

58
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:10,001
I'll click on data validation, set that to decimal,

59
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:14,001
and set a range between zero and 80 hours a week.

60
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,003
So let's say that job A is offering 40 hours per week.

61
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,005
I'll type that and press tab.

62
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:24,002
And job B is offering 37.75 hours per week.

63
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:27,003
Now we can go back to the home tab,

64
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:30,008
and this time I'll choose number as the format.

65
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:32,005
That reformats the numbers in those cells

66
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,007
and gives them two decimal places.

67
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,007
You can change the number of display decimal places

68
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:38,008
using these buttons here.

69
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:41,009
So I could add a third decimal place if I wanted to,

70
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:44,003
or I can reduce it to only one decimal place.

71
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:48,005
Notice that automatically rounds up the 37.5 to 37.8.

72
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,009
And if I lose the decimal places entirely,

73
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:52,007
it rounds up to 38.

74
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:55,002
But I'll keep this at two decimal places.

75
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,000
Alright so by now,

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,002
you should have the basic idea

77
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,008
of how to enter data into a new worksheet from scratch,

78
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:02,009
as well as how to validate and format the contents of cells.
