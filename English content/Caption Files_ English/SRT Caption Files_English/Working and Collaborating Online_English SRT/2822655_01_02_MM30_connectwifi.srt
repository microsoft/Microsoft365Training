00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] Wi-Fi networks allow you

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:05,000
to get online without the use of a wired ethernet connection

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,002
in places like your home or office,

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:11,000
or in hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and so on.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,001
Let's take a look at how to connect to a Wi-Fi network

6
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,003
on a Windows 10 computer.

7
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,005
The first step is to check your Wi-Fi status,

8
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,000
which you can see in the right hand side

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,005
of the task bar at the bottom of your screen.

10
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,005
Notice this icon that looks like a globe,

11
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,004
which you can think of as representing the worldwide web.

12
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,006
If I roll my mouse over that icon,

13
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,000
I can see a message telling me

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,001
I'm not currently connected to a network

15
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,006
and it says no connections are available.

16
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,007
Now I know for a fact that there are Wi-Fi networks

17
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:37,008
where I am right now.

18
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,005
So this probably means that the Wi-Fi

19
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,003
on my computer is turned off.

20
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,002
So I need to turn it back on.

21
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,006
I can do that simply by clicking this icon.

22
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,007
Here I'll click Wi-Fi.

23
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,006
I've re-enabled Wi-Fi on my computer

24
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:52,001
and now I see a list of nearby Wi-Fi networks along

25
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,001
with their signal strength.

26
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,002
The more bars you see in the icon next to the network,

27
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,009
the stronger the connection.

28
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,006
Generally, the stronger the connection,

29
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,000
the faster and more consistent

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the Wi-Fi performance will be.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,008
So you can see,

32
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,008
I only have a couple bars down on this network here,

33
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,009
a few more here.

34
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,009
But here at the top,

35
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:10,005
we see full strength Wi-Fi signals.

36
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:11,003
In most cases,

37
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:12,005
you'll want to connect to a network

38
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,009
whose name you recognize.

39
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,000
This might be your home or office network

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,007
or a network in the coffee shop you're sitting in.

41
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:20,006
You'll also usually see the word secured

42
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,001
under the Wi-Fi network name,

43
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,009
indicating that the network is password protected.

44
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,002
You can connect to networks that are labeled open,

45
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:29,004
but they'll often be set up with other security measures

46
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,003
that require you to validate your identity

47
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:34,000
before allowing you to fully connect.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,009
As a rule of thumb,

49
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:36,006
you shouldn't connect to unknown networks

50
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:37,008
as a matter of etiquette,

51
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:40,004
but also for security reasons.

52
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:41,002
In this case,

53
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:42,009
I do know that this one in particular is a trusted network,

54
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,000
so I'll select it.

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,005
If I want to automatically connect

56
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,004
to this network in the future,

57
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,007
I'll make sure connect automatically is checked.

58
00:01:49,007 --> 00:01:51,008
And then I'll click connect.

59
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:53,006
I'm prompted to enter the password.

60
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,001
If you're connecting to your own network,

61
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,007
you should know the password.

62
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,002
If you're connecting to a Wi-Fi network

63
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,005
at a business or a shop,

64
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:01,006
you may have to ask for the password.

65
00:02:01,006 --> 00:02:02,004
For security,

66
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:04,003
the password is displayed as dots.

67
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:05,001
But if you want,

68
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,004
you can check that you're typing it correctly

69
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:09,004
by clicking and holding on this eye icon.

70
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,005
When you release that button,

71
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,003
it'll go back to being dots.

72
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,007
Once you enter the password, click next.

73
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,003
Depending on how your computer is configured,

74
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:19,000
you may see this message asking if you want your computer

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,005
to be seen by other computers on the network.

76
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:23,007
If you're connecting to your home or office network,

77
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,008
click yes.

78
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:26,001
Being able to see other computers

79
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,002
on your network makes it easy

80
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:29,007
to transfer files between them.

81
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,001
Now I see the message that I'm connected

82
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,004
to my Wi-Fi network.

83
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:34,000
So I can open up my internet browser

84
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and start visiting websites.
