- [Presenter] The internet allows us to communicate

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:05,000
with other people in lots of different ways.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,003
However, it isn't always safe

4
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,005
to communicate with other people online.

5
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:10,005
You don't always know for sure who you're talking to

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,008
when you're on the internet,

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,005
and every day online predators

8
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,005
pretend to be people they aren't.

9
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,004
Here are some tips you can use to keep yourself safer

10
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:20,000
when communicating online.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,001
First, listen to your instincts.

12
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,006
If someone makes you feel nervous or uncomfortable

13
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:26,002
by asking probing questions

14
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,002
or trying to get information out of you,

15
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,007
stop communicating with them right away.

16
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,003
Most websites and social media sites have tools

17
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,006
that you can use to report suspicious activity.

18
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:38,008
Second, limit what you share.

19
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,006
Online predators often try to get you

20
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,008
to share personal information through emails

21
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,008
or other messaging services.

22
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:46,006
Just like you wouldn't share personal information

23
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,001
with a stranger on the street,

24
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,005
don't share information with strangers online, either.

25
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,008
And third, keep your distance.

26
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:55,006
Think twice about meeting someone in person

27
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,008
that you have only talked to online.

28
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,008
Online predators often use social media

29
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:01,002
to pretend to be someone else

30
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:04,007
by setting up fake profiles using other people's pictures.

31
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:06,003
Even if someone seems friendly,

32
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:08,007
it can be difficult to know for sure who they really are

33
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:11,000
when you're just talking online.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,004
Always tell someone you trust

35
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,008
when an online stranger asks to meet you in person,

36
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:18,000
so you don't end up in a dangerous situation.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,005
Keep these risks and tips in mind so you can stay safe

38
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:22,001
when you talk to people online.
