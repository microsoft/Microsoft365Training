00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] A big part of staying safe

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,002
and keeping your information private online

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:05,009
is protecting your information,

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,001
your accounts, and your computer, by using strong passwords.

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,002
A strong password is like a strong lock for your home.

6
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,000
You want a lock that is hard to break,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,002
and you don't want anyone else finding the key to your lock.

8
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:21,004
Here's some tips for creating a strong password.

9
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,003
Use a combination of letters, numbers,

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,003
and symbols in your password.

11
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,009
Using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters

12
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,008
and characters and adding numbers can improve the strength

13
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,005
of your password.

14
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,009
Avoid using common words in your password.

15
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,000
This includes common words

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and phrases like password or website,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,006
as well as personal keywords

18
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,008
that might be easily guessed like your birthday,

19
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:45,001
your name, or your hometown.

20
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,002
Hackers can easily guess

21
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:49,001
or research these phrases in your password.

22
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,008
So a unique combination of characters

23
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:53,007
and numbers creates a stronger password.

24
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,008
For example, let's say I wanted

25
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:57,002
to use the word penguin as my password.

26
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,002
That's way too common a word.

27
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,006
So one trick is to think of ways

28
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:02,004
to obscure the word you want to use,

29
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,001
but still make sure you can remember it

30
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,005
when it's time to enter your password.

31
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:10,001
Let's say that the year 1972 is personally important to me,

32
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,001
but it's not an obvious year like my birth year

33
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,000
that could be easily guessed by others.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,002
So I might come up with a password like this,

35
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:18,008
where I placed penguin between the digits of the year

36
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,008
and capitalize two of its letters.

37
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,001
And then I add a symbol at the end

38
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,006
to make it that much more difficult to guess.

39
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:25,005
This is much safer

40
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:27,008
than just using the word penguin by itself,

41
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:31,001
and it's a password I can remember without writing down.

42
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,005
You can come up with your own strategy

43
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,007
for creating passwords with the methods similar to this.

44
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:37,004
Now, with that said,

45
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:40,003
don't use the same password for multiple sites.

46
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,003
Instead use different passwords for different accounts,

47
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,005
because if someone guesses your email password,

48
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,003
your safety and privacy may be in trouble

49
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:50,004
if you use the same password for your bank account.

50
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:51,007
Be sure to use different passwords

51
00:01:51,007 --> 00:01:54,003
for each online account you have.

52
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,007
And your password is only for you.

53
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,003
When you share it with others, even friends and family,

54
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:01,003
it's more likely that someone else will use it

55
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,000
or won't keep it safe.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,001
Keep your passwords to yourself.

57
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,003
When you log in to accounts, make sure you log out

58
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:09,006
when you're done and don't save your login information

59
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,005
on a public computer.

60
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,009
And as a general rule,

61
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:14,004
you should avoid doing personal business

62
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:16,007
on public computers and public networks

63
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,002
as this makes it easier for hackers

64
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:20,005
to access your information.

65
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,001
Remember, using strong passwords

66
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,009
and keeping them secure is important

67
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,002
for your online safety and privacy.

68
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:29,000
Keep these tips in mind when you create a new password.
