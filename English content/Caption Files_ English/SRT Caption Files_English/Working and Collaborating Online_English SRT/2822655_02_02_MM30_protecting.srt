00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Narrator] There are a lot of positive things

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:03,001
we can do online.

3
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:04,007
We can talk to friends and family,

4
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:07,001
we can make purchases and conduct business

5
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,004
all from behind our computers or mobile devices.

6
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:13,000
But online interactions aren't always safe.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,005
There are always inherent risks in being active online,

8
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,007
so it's important to be aware

9
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:19,002
of the common scams that are out there.

10
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,003
One such scam is phishing.

11
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,005
Your personal information is a valuable asset

12
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:26,004
to people who want to steal it in order to sell it to others

13
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,000
or to impersonate you online

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,008
in order to access your various accounts.

15
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,008
Much like a common method for catching fish is

16
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:35,004
to put bait on a hook so the fish will want to eat it,

17
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:37,002
phishers have many different types of bait they use

18
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,000
to try to fool people into sharing information

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,003
like their passwords, credit card information,

20
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,004
and other private data.

21
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:45,006
They may send you an email or an instant message

22
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,009
through a social media site

23
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:48,008
or an online game you're playing.

24
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:50,003
They may pretend to be someone else

25
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,006
or make it look like they're an employee of a site you use

26
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:54,008
like a bank or your internet service provider

27
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,007
and ask you to click links to complete a task

28
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:59,002
under the guise of protecting your information

29
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:01,006
or making you think you're in some kind of trouble.

30
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,009
If you click their links or give them information,

31
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,007
they've hooked you like a fish.

32
00:01:05,007 --> 00:01:07,002
So let's take a look at four practices

33
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:10,002
you can follow to avoid being hooked by these scammers.

34
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:13,003
First, be cautious of suspicious messages.

35
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,002
Scammers try to make their messages look official

36
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,002
and familiar to make you trust them,

37
00:01:17,002 --> 00:01:19,008
often asking for you to confirm personal information

38
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,007
or account passwords.

39
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,001
Examine messages carefully

40
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:26,001
and avoid sharing information over messages or email.

41
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:27,008
If you receive a message claiming to be

42
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:28,008
from a company you've shopped

43
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,009
with in the past asking you to reply

44
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:34,001
with a password or other information, don't do it.

45
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,004
Instead, go to that company's website directly

46
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:38,006
from your browser and log into your account.

47
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:40,004
If they really need information from you,

48
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:43,000
you'll most likely see a message when you log in.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,005
Alternately, call the company's

50
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:46,008
customer service line yourself.

51
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:50,003
Second, look for signs that a webpage is safe and secure.

52
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,001
Before you provide credit card information

53
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,006
or enter a password or other personal info,

54
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:56,005
take a look at the address bar in your browser

55
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,008
and make sure you either see a lock icon

56
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:04,000
or that the web address starts with HTTPS, not just HTTP.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,001
The lock and HTTPS indicate

58
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,000
that the site is secure and encrypted,

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,005
so it's highly unlikely your information can be intercepted.

60
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,009
On top of that, make sure you're on the right webpage.

61
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,002
Scammers sometimes set up websites with addresses

62
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,009
very close to legitimate sites

63
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:19,005
and even design their scam sites

64
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,007
to look like those legitimate sites.

65
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,006
Oftentimes they'll misspell the company's name

66
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:25,006
or use a different domain address.

67
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,009
For example, they might have registered a dot net version

68
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,002
of a company's dot com address.

69
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:31,006
Always check the address to make sure you're

70
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,005
on the right page.

71
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,007
Third, keep your web browser

72
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,006
and operating system up-to-date.

73
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:38,000
You can turn on automatic updates

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,006
to make sure the latest software releases

75
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,008
are automatically installed on your computer,

76
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,001
which means you'll always receive

77
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:46,005
the latest security updates that help protect your computer.

78
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:49,004
And fourth, consider installing anti-malware software

79
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:50,006
on your computer.

80
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,008
This is special software designed to protect your computer

81
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:55,002
from malicious software and hackers.

82
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,007
Sometimes scammers trick people

83
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:59,001
into installing what looks like legitimate software,

84
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:02,001
but turns out to be software that tracks and steals data.

85
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:05,000
Anti-malware software can identify these malicious programs

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,004
and delete them from your computer.

87
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,007
Again, with all of its benefits,

88
00:03:08,007 --> 00:03:11,000
there are still always risks to being online.

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,004
So you'll always want to stay vigilant and cautious

90
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,005
to protect yourself from phishing scams.
