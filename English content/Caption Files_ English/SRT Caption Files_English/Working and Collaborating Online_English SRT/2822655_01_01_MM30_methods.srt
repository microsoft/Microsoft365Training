1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,002
- To access information and to communicate

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:05,007
with others online, you first need to connect

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:07,000
to the internet.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,009
This is also known as getting online.

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,002
To do this you need an internet capable device

6
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,000
to connect to a network.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,001
These devices include desktop and laptop computers,

8
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,007
mobile phones and tablets.

9
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:22,001
Nearly all modern devices in these categories

10
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,002
have the ability to connect to networks to get online.

11
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:29,000
Essentially, the internet is made up of a set of networks

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,009
that are connected to each other all across the world

13
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,001
and you get online and on the internet

14
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,006
by connecting to one of these networks.

15
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:38,006
Oftentimes you'll be connecting to a network

16
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:41,003
that's been set up in your home or place of work.

17
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:42,006
Depending on the device you're using,

18
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:45,002
you can connect the networks in different ways.

19
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,005
For example, if you're using a desktop computer,

20
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,004
you may have a wired connection to your network

21
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,005
for internet access.

22
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:53,002
Many laptop computers also have ports

23
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,009
to support a wired connection as well.

24
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:57,007
For a wired connection, you'll use a cable

25
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,002
called an ethernet cable to connect your computer

26
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:03,004
to your network device, often called a router.

27
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:05,009
Most laptop computers also have the ability to connect

28
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,001
to wifi networks, which is a wireless form of connection,

29
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,005
so you can choose between a wired and wireless connection

30
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,002
from most laptops.

31
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,008
When using portable devices like mobile phones and tablets,

32
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,000
you'll also typically connect to your network via wifi.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,001
If your mobile phone or tablet has a data plan

34
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,003
through your mobile provider, you can also connect

35
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,007
to the internet wirelessly over cellular signals

36
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,006
when wifi isn't available.

37
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:30,006
This is referred to as mobile broadband.

38
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,002
When you're on the go though, connecting to wifi networks

39
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,001
is generally the best option as many mobile providers

40
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,007
limit the amount of data you can transfer

41
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:40,004
over mobile broadband and may charge extra fees

42
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:42,005
for going over your limit.

43
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,000
Publicly available wifi networks are also available

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,001
in places like airports, hotels,

45
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,005
shopping centers, and restaurants.

46
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,005
Oftentimes public wifi networks are password protected,

47
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,002
which is a method for securing the network

48
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:56,004
from being accessed by just anyone.

49
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,008
For example, a coffee shop may decide to only share

50
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:01,008
the password to their wifi network with customers.

51
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:04,007
Similarly, the wifi network you may have set up in your home

52
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,007
should also be password protected to prevent people

53
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,005
from outside your household from connecting to it.

54
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,006
Home networks are usually set up

55
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,007
by your internet service provider or ISP.

56
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,005
Your ISP sets you up with a modem

57
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,008
for creating the connection from your home to the internet

58
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:19,008
and often the service includes a router

59
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,008
which allows multiple computers and devices

60
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,009
to connect to the internet at the same time,

61
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,003
either wired or wirelessly.

62
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:28,005
For the most part, getting online is quick and easy

63
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:31,002
as long as you have an available network to connect to.
