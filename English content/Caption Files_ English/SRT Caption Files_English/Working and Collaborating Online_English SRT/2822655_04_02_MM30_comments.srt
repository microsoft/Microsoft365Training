00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,004
- [Instructor] When working on a document with your team,

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,000
you don't have to call a meeting every time

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,006
you need to share notes or comments with each other.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
With Microsoft Word, you and your team members

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,005
can add comments directly to the document

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,005
for everyone to see and review.

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,002
This allows everyone to share feedback

8
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:17,007
and collaborate in one place, the document itself.

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,006
To make a comment, place your cursor at the location

10
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,009
in the document where you want the comment to appear.

11
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,001
For example, I'll place my cursor

12
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:25,006
next to this logo at the top of the page.

13
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,009
Then I'll go to the Review tab of the ribbon.

14
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,003
And from here, I'll click New Comment.

15
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,003
You can see it draws a line from where my cursor was

16
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:37,000
over here to the side, and I can type my comment.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,005
So it's that easy.

18
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,007
You can also highlight specific words or phrases

19
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,005
to apply your comments to so it's clear

20
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,000
what you're commenting on.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,003
For example, I noticed that the name of the hotel founder

22
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,009
is misspelled a few times in this document.

23
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:50,009
So I'll highlight one of those misspellings,

24
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,007
and this time, I'll right-click on that

25
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:55,003
and choose New Comment.

26
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,005
And now I can type my comment just like before.

27
00:00:57,005 --> 00:01:00,003
You can also read and respond to comments left by others.

28
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:01,006
If I scroll down a bit,

29
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,009
notice here we have a comment left by Jake.

30
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:05,009
When I roll over it, I can click Reply

31
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,008
and start a conversation thread on this particular comment.

32
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:12,007
You can also click Resolve when an issue has been addressed.

33
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,007
That grays out the comment

34
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:15,006
so others can see that it's been handled.

35
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:17,005
But they can still read and review the comment thread

36
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:18,006
if they need to.

37
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,001
If you want to remove a comment entirely

38
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,001
from the document, you can use the Delete button

39
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,009
here in the Review tab.

40
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,003
If you want to hide comments from view

41
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:26,005
without deleting them,

42
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:29,002
toggle them with the Show Comments button.

43
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,009
You can see that hides all of my comments,

44
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,009
and now I just see these little comment icons

45
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,001
indicating where they are in the document.

46
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,008
I can click on them to read them.

47
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,003
And if I want to see them again,

48
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:42,002
I can just click Show Comments.

49
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,004
So as you can see,

50
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,005
comments are a useful tool for collaborating

51
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:47,009
and sharing feedback on a document with others.
