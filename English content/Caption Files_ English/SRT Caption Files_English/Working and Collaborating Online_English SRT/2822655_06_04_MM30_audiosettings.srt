1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,003
- Before you start using Skype to make calls

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,005
you should make sure your audio and video settings are

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,004
configured properly so others can hear or see you.

4
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,007
You should always confirm your settings before making or

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,009
receiving a call.

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,006
You don't want to be fumbling around with your settings

7
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:13,005
during a call,

8
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,009
especially if it's an important or professional call.

9
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:19,000
Here in Skype, start by clicking this three dot button

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,007
and selecting settings, and then select audio and video.

11
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:27,008
And here at the top next to camera,

12
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:30,000
if you have multiple cameras connected to your computer,

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,002
you can choose the one you want to use in Skype.

14
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,003
I'm using a surface tablet.

15
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,000
So I have both a front facing camera and a rear facing

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,007
camera, but for Skype calls,

17
00:00:37,007 --> 00:00:41,000
I most likely want to keep my front facing camera selected.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,001
Once you've selected your camera,

19
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,009
you can scroll down to your audio settings.

20
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,004
Here next to microphone,

21
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,007
you can choose the microphone you want to use.

22
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:50,000
This might be your computer's default built in microphone,

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,005
or you may have connected a USB microphone,

24
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:55,001
or you might want to use a microphone built into an external

25
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,009
webcam you've connected to your computer.

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,004
Notice as I'm speaking, we're seeing this meter move,

27
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,007
and this is telling me the audio levels that are going into

28
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:05,003
the microphone and Skype is actually doing a pretty good job

29
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,002
of keeping those levels even.

30
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,001
If you want,

31
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,009
you can turn this automatically adjust microphone settings

32
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,006
switch off and manually adjust your microphone settings.

33
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,006
Basically, you don't want the levels getting all the way

34
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:16,004
to the right here.

35
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:19,009
I'm just going to leave it set to auto in this case.

36
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:21,005
Below that you can choose the speakers you want

37
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,003
to use to listen to audio through Skype.

38
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,003
This could be your devices built in speakers,

39
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:28,004
external speakers, a Bluetooth headset

40
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,007
you've paired to your computer, and so on.

41
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,003
By clicking the test audio button,

42
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:33,006
you can check if the audio is playing

43
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,005
through your selected speakers.

44
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:38,003
(computer dinging)

45
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:40,000
Now, if you don't hear anything,

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,007
double check to make sure you have the right speakers

47
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:44,004
selected and then on your speakers or headset themselves,

48
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:48,000
make sure they're turned on and not muted.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,006
You can close settings,

50
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,009
and once you have your video and audio settings configured,

51
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,004
you're ready to make a call.

52
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,003
Let's try a video call.

53
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,003
I'll come over here to my contacts,

54
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,009
and I want to get my friend Nick a call.

55
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,006
So I'll select his name

56
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,002
and here in the upper right hand corner,

57
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,008
I could click the phone button to make an audio call over

58
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:06,002
Skype, but in this case,

59
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:11,003
I'll click the video camera icon to make a video call.

60
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:14,009
And I could see myself as a call is being placed.

61
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:18,006
And in a second, there's Nick, Hey Nick.

62
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,005
- Hello.

63
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,005
- Thanks for helping me out with this.

64
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,006
- No problem.

65
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:22,008
- So that's pretty much all there is

66
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,007
to making a video call and Skype.

67
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,007
We can now both see and hear each other,

68
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:29,002
and we can have a conversation and Skype, anytime we like,

69
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:32,005
as long as we both someplace with an internet connection.

70
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,006
So at this point,

71
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,008
I want to show what it looks like if we receive a video

72
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,001
call, so Nick, I'm going to hang up,

73
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:40,000
but could you call me back in just a couple seconds?

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,009
- No problem.

75
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,007
- Alright.

76
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,003
See in a second.

77
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:44,007
All right, so to receive a call,

78
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,000
Skype needs to be running

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,001
and now we can see Nick is calling.

80
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,008
Now I could click the phone button if I only wanted to

81
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,000
answer with audio or I can hang up if I didn't want to

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,002
answer it all.

83
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:59,004
But in this case, I will answer with the video button again.

84
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,004
And once again, there's Nick.

85
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,004
Hello again.

86
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:02,002
- Hey.

87
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,002
- So that's pretty much it.

88
00:03:03,002 --> 00:03:04,009
We can now just continue having our normal conversation

89
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,000
here over video.

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,009
All right, so thanks again, Nick.

91
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,008
- No problem.

92
00:03:09,008 --> 00:03:12,003
- All right, we'll talk to you later.

93
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:13,009
Okay, so that's how you set up your audio

94
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:14,008
and video settings.

95
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:17,002
So you can make and receive calls in Skype.
