1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] On your computer, your web browser

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,002
is the software you need in order to access

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:07,003
and interact with the content on the web.

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,002
Most operating systems come with at least one

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,002
built in web browser application.

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:14,004
For example, Mac OS computers include the Safari browser

7
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,009
and Windows 10 includes Microsoft Edge

8
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:18,000
but there are several other browsers

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,006
on the market to choose from including Google Chrome

10
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:22,008
and Mozilla Firefox.

11
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:25,006
At the most basic level, all browsers allow you to access

12
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,006
websites, download files, images, and videos

13
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,008
on websites and so on.

14
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,009
Browsers mainly vary in the features they include

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,001
but these days most browsers have very similar features.

16
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,005
Here we'll take a look at browsing the web

17
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,006
with Microsoft Edge, but you'll be able to use

18
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,005
other modern browsers in mostly the same away.

19
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:45,006
I'll open up Microsoft Edge and there it is.

20
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:48,006
To access a website, we enter the URL or address

21
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,000
of the site into the address bar at the top of the window.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,009
The browser loads the webpage and it's displayed

23
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:55,005
in the main part of the window.

24
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:57,004
We can use the scroll bar to scroll down the page

25
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:59,002
to view it and to interact with all the elements

26
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,009
on the page.

27
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,008
White pages usually contain hyperlinks,

28
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:05,004
often just called links, that point to other pages

29
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,008
on the website or to entirely different websites.

30
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,006
You can often tell if text is a hyperlink

31
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,008
by its appearance.

32
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:13,009
It's usually a different color from the surrounding text

33
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,005
like we see here, or it becomes underlined or already

34
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:18,009
is underlined, or it's just visually different

35
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:20,003
in some other way.

36
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,002
Alternately, if you place your mouse over text

37
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,003
or an image and the cursor turns into a hand

38
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,000
with a pointing finger, that indicates

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the item is a clickable link.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,007
You'll also see the address that clicking the link

41
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,002
will take you to there in the lower left hand corner

42
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:35,001
and if I click that link I'll go to that page.

43
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,007
And now we're looking at the webpage that was linked

44
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:40,002
from the previous page and we can start browsing this page.

45
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,003
If necessary, you can go back to the previous page

46
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:45,002
by clicking the back button in the browser.

47
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:46,008
Similarly, you can click the forward button

48
00:01:46,008 --> 00:01:48,009
to view that link page again.

49
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,003
Although it's easy to move back and forth

50
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:52,004
between pages like this, there are often times

51
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:54,003
when you need to reference multiple webpages

52
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:57,008
at the same time and going back and forth can get tedious.

53
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,004
A solution is to use tabs which are a feature

54
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,004
of web browsers which allow you to open multiple

55
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:05,006
webpages at the same time in the same browser window.

56
00:02:05,006 --> 00:02:07,008
For example, maybe I'm searching for Microsoft Surface

57
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:11,005
tablets, I'll click that link, and as you can see

58
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,004
there are many different models to choose from here.

59
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,002
Clicking one of these takes me to the page

60
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,008
about that model and then I need to click the back button

61
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,008
to go back to the links to look at the other models.

62
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,009
To save time, I'm going to right click on the link

63
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:28,004
and choose open link in new tab.

64
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,003
In this particular browser, that opens a new tab

65
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,007
here in the background and you can see

66
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:33,004
the title of the page here.

67
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:35,003
In some web browsers, depending on your settings,

68
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:38,003
the new tab may open in the front, but in either case

69
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:39,009
you can switch back and forth between tabs

70
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:41,008
just by clicking on them.

71
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:43,007
So now I can right click on the links for the other

72
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:45,005
product versions I'm interested in

73
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:51,002
and open them in new tabs as well.

74
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,009
And once I've done that I can now switch among

75
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:57,004
all the tabs to do my research.

76
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,002
You can also open the web pages in new windows

77
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:03,004
by right clicking and choosing open link in new window.

78
00:03:03,004 --> 00:03:05,007
Opening links in new windows can help you stay organized

79
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,008
by grouping related tabs in their own window

80
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:10,004
and opening unrelated tabs in other windows,

81
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,006
but that's a matter of personal preference.

82
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,002
But because these are separate windows, I can move

83
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:15,007
this one slightly out of the way and still see

84
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,008
the other window here in the background

85
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:20,003
and I can switch to that if I needed to.

86
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:22,001
You can always keep track of the web pages you visit

87
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,003
by using the history feature of the browser.

88
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,001
In Edge, click the three dot button here

89
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,009
in the upper right hand corner

90
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,002
and roll your mouse over history

91
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,005
and from here I can choose manage history

92
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:34,006
to see a list of the web pages I visited,

93
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,002
organized by date.

94
00:03:36,002 --> 00:03:38,001
You have the option to clear web pages from your history

95
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:39,009
whenever you like, which you can do by clicking

96
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:42,005
clear browsing data and here I can choose

97
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:45,001
to clear the browsing history from the last 24 hours,

98
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,009
the last hour, the last seven days, the last four weeks

99
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,000
and all of my browsing history.

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,004
I'll leave that as is for now though.

101
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:54,001
Again, you'll find all the features we've seen here

102
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,004
in Microsoft Edge in other browsers as well,

103
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:59,000
but they may be located in different places.

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,007
But once you familiarize yourself with your preferred

105
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,004
browser, you'll find these features make it easy

106
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,004
to browse the web.
