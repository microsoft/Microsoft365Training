00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] An important aspect of the web

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,004
is that the information found there should be available

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,008
and accessible to everyone equally.

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:09,009
That's why both modern websites and modern web browsers

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,008
include accessibility features and options to help people

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:16,000
browse the web in the way that best suits their needs.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,006
For example, the Microsoft Edge browser includes options

8
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:21,005
to assist people who may have vision or motor impairments

9
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,009
better navigate the web pages they visit.

10
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,004
You can zoom into a webpage by pressing the Control button

11
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:29,009
and the plus sign on your keyboard.

12
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,001
And that can make it easier to read the text and to see

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,007
the images on the page.

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,007
Similarly, pressing Control and the minus key

15
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:38,002
lets you zoom out, which can make it easier to get

16
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:41,007
a view of the entire page and orient yourself to its layout.

17
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,006
Alternately, if you have trouble pressing multiple keys

18
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:45,006
at the same time to use the zoom feature,

19
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,006
you can also hold the Control key with one hand

20
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:50,003
and turn the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out.

21
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,006
And pressing Control-zero resets the page back

22
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:54,002
to its default size.

23
00:00:54,002 --> 00:00:55,007
Another option for reading web pages

24
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,008
is the Immersive Reader feature.

25
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,008
This is only available or partially available

26
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:01,006
on some webpages.

27
00:01:01,006 --> 00:01:03,004
If it's available on the page you're viewing,

28
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,008
you'll find the Immersive Reader button here

29
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:07,005
in the address bar of Edge.

30
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:09,009
And as you can see, that displays the text on the page

31
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,000
at a larger size and in a cleaner layout

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,008
with fewer distractions.

33
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:16,006
At the top of the screen, you can click on Text preferences

34
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,004
to adjust how the text is displayed and the color

35
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:20,001
of the background it appears on.

36
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,007
So I can make the text larger and maybe change it

37
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,006
to white on black.

38
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,007
For some people, higher contrast themes like this

39
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,008
make it easier to read text.

40
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,004
I'll close the Immersive Reader view by clicking

41
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,006
its button again.

42
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:34,005
You can even have Edge read web pages aloud to you.

43
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:36,001
This can be useful if you have difficulty reading

44
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,005
long passages of text, for example.

45
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,006
Just right-click on the text you want to have read to you

46
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,005
and choose Read aloud and Edge will read and highlight

47
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,007
the words as it speaks them.

48
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:48,001
- [Edge] As people continue to turn to online learning

49
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,006
to adapt, many people are investing

50
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:53,004
in this highly strategic skill.

51
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,000
While all levels within the organization.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,005
- [Instructor] And I can pause that with the controls

53
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:58,009
at the top of the screen.

54
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,004
You can also click voice options to adjust the speed

55
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:04,001
it reads to you and the voice it uses.

56
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:06,003
And for users who may have difficulty using a mouse

57
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,006
when browsing, Edge includes several keyboard shortcuts.

58
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,007
Press F6 on the keyboard to cycle through the elements

59
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,007
of the browser like the tab bar, the address bar,

60
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,002
the content of the web page, and so on.

61
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,006
So for example, I have two other tabs open.

62
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:22,002
So I can press F6 until I see the first tab highlight.

63
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:25,001
And then use the arrow keys on my keyboard to navigate

64
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:28,002
to the tab I want to view.

65
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,006
And press Enter to bring it to the front.

66
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:34,004
Or I can press F6 until the address bar is highlighted

67
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,006
so I can type in the address of the website I want to visit.

68
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,004
Pressing the Tab key lets you move forward

69
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:41,002
through the elements on the page.

70
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,003
That includes links, text fields on forms,

71
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:44,006
and the address bar.

72
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:47,005
And Shift-Tab lets you move backwards.

73
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,009
And pressing Shift-F10 is like right-clicking

74
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:52,001
on a selected element.

75
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,006
These are just a few examples of the accessibility features

76
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:57,004
built into Microsoft Edge that make it easier for everyone

77
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,005
to browse and interact with webpages.
