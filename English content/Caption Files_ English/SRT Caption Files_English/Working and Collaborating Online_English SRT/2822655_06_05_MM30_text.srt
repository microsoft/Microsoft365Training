00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] When logged into Skype,

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,001
you and your contacts can keep track

3
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,005
of each other's availability with the presence indicators.

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,002
You can set your own presence status

5
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:10,007
by clicking the colored dot next to your name.

6
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:11,007
Active is green

7
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,008
and means that you're actively using your computer

8
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:17,000
and are generally available to receive messages and calls.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,004
This doesn't mean that you have to receive

10
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:20,000
and reply to messages right away,

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,005
but it's a good idea to set your status

12
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:24,002
to let your friends and coworkers know your availability

13
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:25,009
so they have a better idea of when they might

14
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,006
get a reply from you.

15
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,002
So you can set your status to away

16
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:31,007
if you're away from your computer,

17
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,002
in a meeting, and so on,

18
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:35,001
which turns your icon yellow,

19
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:36,002
and that lets your contacts know

20
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,008
that you may not respond right away,

21
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:40,007
but that you're still able to receive messages.

22
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:41,007
And do not disturb

23
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,008
not only turns the presence indicator red,

24
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,001
but it will also mute notifications about incoming messages

25
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:48,005
so you truly won't be disturbed

26
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,005
by people trying to text or call you.

27
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:53,003
Your contacts will still see that you're logged into Skype,

28
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,002
but the red indicator will let them know that you aren't

29
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:57,006
receiving notifications at the moment.

30
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,006
And for times when you went to remain on Skype

31
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,001
but not show up as online,

32
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,005
you can choose the invisible option.

33
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,006
I'll set mine back to active.

34
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:07,005
Now, regardless of someone's presence indicator,

35
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:09,004
you can send them a text message at any time

36
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:12,000
by clicking their name in your contact list

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,006
and then just start typing a message.

38
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:19,002
I'll press Enter to send that message to Jade.

39
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,003
Now, when I see Jade's icon or initials appear

40
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,006
below that message,

41
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:24,006
that tells me that she's seen the message,

42
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:26,004
and notice that when she starts replying,

43
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:29,006
we see a message here that Jade is typing.

44
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,006
And now I've received a reply from Jade

45
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:36,004
and I can again reply to her.

46
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,003
Now I can see that Jade has set her status to away

47
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:41,008
so I know that I might not receive a reply right away,

48
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:42,009
so I can just leave Skype running

49
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,005
to check in with my other contacts

50
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:46,006
or while I do other work on my computer.

51
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,005
And that's how to have a text-based conversation in Skype.
