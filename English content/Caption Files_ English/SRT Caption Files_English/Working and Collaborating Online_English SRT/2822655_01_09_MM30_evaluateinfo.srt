1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,007
- The web is full of millions of web pages

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,007
containing a wealth of information.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:06,003
It's an incredible resource,

4
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:07,008
but it's also crucial to keep in mind

5
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,009
that anyone can create content and place it on the web.

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,008
And that's one of the web's greatest benefits

7
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,005
as well as one of its potential detriments.

8
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,007
It's important to be critical

9
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,009
when evaluating the accuracy and credibility

10
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,006
of the content you come across online.

11
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:23,005
Here are a few strategies you can use

12
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,007
to judge whether a webpage is reliable

13
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:29,005
and if the information you find is factual or false.

14
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,003
You could start with something

15
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:31,006
as simple as checking the date

16
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:34,000
the article you're reading was published.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,009
Some information on the web is incredibly outdated

18
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,005
and may not have been updated in years.

19
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:42,000
Even if the information was accurate at the time,

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,005
it may no longer be reliable

21
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:46,006
as new data and studies may have emerged since then.

22
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:47,009
If you determine that the information

23
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:49,008
is recent and up-to-date,

24
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,002
next think about who published the information

25
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:55,003
and what motivation they might have for doing so.

26
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,002
While some publishers

27
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,004
want to share factual information online,

28
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:00,006
others may be motivated by making money

29
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:02,004
or gaining followers online,

30
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,001
or just spreading their personal beliefs,

31
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,005
regardless of actual facts.

32
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,001
For example, you may come across an article

33
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,005
that says everyone should wear hats when outdoors

34
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,000
because sunlight is getting more and more dangerous.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,006
But then you notice that the article is posted

36
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,000
on a website that sells hats.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,002
Now it may, in fact, be true

38
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,008
that exposure to sunlight is becoming more dangerous,

39
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:22,009
which is why it's important to check multiple sources

40
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,002
to confirm information you find.

41
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,006
But it's also possible that the author of this article

42
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,001
is sharing biased information

43
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,004
in order to sell more of their hats.

44
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,004
Bias isn't always bad, though.

45
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,000
Personal bloggers who publish articles on their own sites

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,009
to share their thoughts and ideas

47
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:41,003
may present valuable information or unique perspectives,

48
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,005
but it's still important to consider

49
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,003
what biases the author may have

50
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:47,008
and be able to distinguish between opinion and fact.

51
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,004
Similarly, it's also important

52
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,001
to be aware of your own biases

53
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,009
and to make sure you don't just look for information

54
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,004
that backs up your current opinions

55
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,003
or perception of the facts.

56
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,001
Be open to checking multiple resources

57
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,002
and changing your mind when presented with evidence

58
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:02,002
that contradicts your positions.

59
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:04,005
So those are just a few strategies to keep in mind

60
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:06,000
as you navigate the web

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,002
to help make sure the information you find and use

62
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,006
is as reliable and accurate as possible.
