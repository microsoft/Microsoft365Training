- [Instructor] The World Wide Web,

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:03,009
also known as the web for short,

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,005
is a system that allows us to find information,

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:10,006
publish content, and get things done using the internet.

5
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:13,000
The documents on the web are called web pages,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,007
which usually display information

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:18,001
and provide clickable links to other related web pages.

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,008
Web pages have gotten more and more interactive and robust,

9
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,007
and they exist for a wide variety of uses.

10
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:26,007
You can visit shopping websites to purchase goods online,

11
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,009
airline websites to book flights,

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:31,007
or the social media pages of your friends and relatives

13
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,009
to keep up with what they're doing.

14
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,000
Every webpage has an address on the internet called a URL,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which stands for a uniform resource locator.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,003
To view a webpage, you type its URL into a software tool

17
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:45,001
called a web browser.

18
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,001
Typing an address into a web browser

19
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,000
is similar to dialing a phone number on a phone.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,008
Just like how dialing a phone number connects you

21
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:55,000
to a specific phone, typing a URL connects you

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,002
to the location that webpage is stored, called a web server,

23
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,003
which loads the web pages onto our screens,

24
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,000
so we can read and interact with them.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,002
So by using the web,

26
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,002
we can access almost any type of information

27
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:08,003
from anywhere with an internet connection.
