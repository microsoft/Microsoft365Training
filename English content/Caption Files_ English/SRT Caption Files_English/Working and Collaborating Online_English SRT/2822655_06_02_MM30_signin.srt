00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,004
- [Narrator] To use Skype,

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,008
you'll need to download the Skype app

3
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,001
to your desktop computer or mobile device

4
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,000
by going to skype.com,

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,005
and here you can click the Downloads link.

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,007
The site should automatically detect

7
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,004
the operating system you're using.

8
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,007
For example, here I see Get Skype for Windows,

9
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:17,002
so I could click that to download the version

10
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,001
for the computer that I'm using.

11
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:22,000
If you're on a Mac, you'll see Get Skype for Mac.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,004
If you want to install Skype on your phone or tablet,

13
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:27,001
visit the App Store on Apple iOS devices

14
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,005
or the Google Play store for Android devices,

15
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:33,000
and then you can search for and download the Skype app.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,007
I've already downloaded and installed Skype

17
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:37,000
here on my Windows computer,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,009
and I've pinned it to the taskbar,

19
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:42,003
so I can start it up right from here.

20
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,001
So to use Skype, you'll need to log in with your account.

21
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,008
If you already have a Microsoft account,

22
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,005
you can use that same account to log into Skype.

23
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,005
Some ways you might have already created an account

24
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,008
are if you have a subscription to Microsoft 365,

25
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:58,001
if you have a Hotmail or Outlook.com email address,

26
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,002
or if you have an Xbox Live account.

27
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:03,000
You can use any of these methods to sign into Skype.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you don't yet have a Microsoft account,

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,007
you can click Create One to create one,

30
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:10,004
and then walk through the steps to create your account.

31
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,006
You'll then be able to sign in.

32
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:18,006
In this case, I'll sign in with an account I already have.

33
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:22,003
And I'll enter my password.

34
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:23,003
And once you're signed in,

35
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,004
you can start making and receiving calls,

36
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,005
sending and receiving instant messages,

37
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,005
or you can set your status

38
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,006
so people who have you in their contacts list

39
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,000
can see your availability.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,003
Setting your status can give your contacts a better idea

41
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:36,003
of whether they can expect

42
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,004
an immediate or a delayed reply from you

43
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,002
when they send you messages.

44
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:42,005
Now, if you want to keep Skype running but hide the app,

45
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,009
you can click the X button to close this window.

46
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,001
You can see here, though, that Skype is still running,

47
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,008
and you'll still receive notifications

48
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,005
if anyone messages or calls you.

49
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,002
You can bring the main window back at any time

50
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,007
by opening up Skype again,

51
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:58,005
either from the taskbar if you have the icon pinned there,

52
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:02,002
or you can do a search for Skype,

53
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:03,009
and open it from here.

54
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,000
When you're done using Skype

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,008
and you want to completely sign out,

56
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:11,001
click this three dot menu, and then choose Sign Out.

57
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:11,009
I'm going to have it remember

58
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,002
my account and application settings

59
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,005
so I don't have to sign in from scratch

60
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:17,004
each time I want to open up Skype.

61
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:19,003
And now I can close this window.

62
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:20,007
Once you've completely signed out,

63
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:22,001
your contacts will no longer be able

64
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:25,000
to see you online or send you messages.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,001
But you can always restart Skype,

66
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,002
select your account, and sign in

67
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:32,002
to make yourself available

68
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,001
to receive messages and calls again.
