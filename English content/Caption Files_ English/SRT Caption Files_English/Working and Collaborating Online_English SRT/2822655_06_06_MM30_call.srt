1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,002
- [Instructor] While many online communication services

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:06,002
allow you to make audio and video calls to other people,

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,002
in most cases, the people you're calling

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:10,005
need to be using the same service.

5
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,006
For example, in the popular WhatsApp communication tool,

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:15,005
you can call other WhatsApp users,

7
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:18,005
but only call other WhatsApp users.

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,004
Skype, on the other hand,

9
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,002
is one of the few communication tools

10
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,002
where in addition to you texting and calling

11
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:27,001
other Skype users, you can also call actual phone numbers.

12
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,009
So from Skype, you can call your friends and family,

13
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,004
the store down the street or in another state,

14
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:35,002
or any business or person who may not have Skype,

15
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,002
but who does have a phone number.

16
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,008
Now, while calls between Skype users are free,

17
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,005
calls from Skype to phone numbers require you to purchase

18
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:45,004
a Skype credit or a Skype subscription.

19
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,006
You can find the rates for your country

20
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:49,001
by going to skype.com,

21
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,007
and here clicking Skype to phone.

22
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,003
Then select your country,

23
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,003
and here you'll see the rates

24
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,008
for Skype credits and subscriptions.

25
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:59,004
If you just want to try out calling phones

26
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:00,003
from Skype, though,

27
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,002
you can make a call up to five minutes in length for free.

28
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:06,004
Just sign into Skype and click the dial pad button.

29
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:17,000
Then enter the phone number you want to call.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,002
And notice it says here I can talk

31
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,000
for five minutes for free.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,009
I'll click the call button.

33
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,000
- [Operator] Hi, you've reached the National Weather Service

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,008
in Oxnard, California.

35
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:31,009
For a recording of the current weather forecast, press one.

36
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:35,002
- [Instructor] And we'll just hang up on that for now.

37
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:38,006
But that's how easy it is to call a phone number from Skype.

38
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,000
Again, if this is something you think you'll frequently do,

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,002
be sure to look into purchasing Skype credits

40
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,003
or a subscription.
