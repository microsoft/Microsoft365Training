1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,003
- The internet makes it possible for us to stay in touch

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,008
with our friends, family, and colleagues online.

3
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,007
Communication can happen in real-time

4
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,008
with apps and services that make it easy

5
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:12,009
to chat through instant messaging,

6
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,009
voice calling and video calls.

7
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,009
Instant messaging is a text-based form of communication,

8
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:21,000
where you can type messages on your computer

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
or mobile device to send to people

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,009
who can then instantly read and respond to your messages

11
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,008
on their devices.

12
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,001
Voice calling over the internet

13
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,005
is similar to traditional phone calls,

14
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:34,004
only instead of using a landline or mobile phone,

15
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:37,006
you place your call over the internet using an app.

16
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:39,009
And video calling is like a voice call,

17
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:41,007
but where you and the people you're calling

18
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,003
can hear and see each other.

19
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:47,000
Which of these three forms of communication you use

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,002
depends on what you determine is appropriate at the time.

21
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:52,005
If you just need to ask a quick question,

22
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:55,000
but don't necessarily need an immediate response,

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,009
you can send an instant message.

24
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,001
Your recipients can then respond when they have a moment.

25
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,009
If you need a more immediate reply,

26
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,007
you can try a voice call.

27
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,006
And video-based calls can make it easier

28
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,007
to have certain conversations because you can see each other

29
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:12,003
and read the expressions on each caller's face.

30
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:14,004
In many cases, there are apps that allow you to use

31
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:16,007
all three of these forms of communication

32
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:20,002
while other apps focus specifically on one or two types.

33
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:21,009
Apple FaceTime, for example,

34
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,001
allows you to make voice and video calls,

35
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,008
but you use a separate Apple app called iMessage

36
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,008
for instant messaging.

37
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:30,008
Another example is WhatsApp,

38
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:32,008
which is an app that lets you send messages

39
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,002
and voice and video chat as well.

40
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:36,006
And there's also Skype,

41
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,008
which in addition to instant messages

42
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:41,009
and voice and video chatting is also one of the few apps

43
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,009
through which you can call phone numbers,

44
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,007
letting you make both domestic and international calls

45
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,003
from your computer or mobile phone.

46
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,001
In this chapter, we'll look more closely

47
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,008
at communicating using Skype.
