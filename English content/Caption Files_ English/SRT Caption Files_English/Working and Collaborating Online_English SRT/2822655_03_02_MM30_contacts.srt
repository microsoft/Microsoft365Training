1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] Most email programs

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,008
let you create and save the contact information

3
00:00:03,008 --> 00:00:05,009
of the people you communicate with.

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,001
This makes it easy to not only send emails to them

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,005
without having to look up their information each time,

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,004
but you can also save

7
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,003
other important information about your contacts

8
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:16,008
that can easily be looked up or referenced at any time.

9
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,006
A contact can be as basic as a name and email address

10
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,009
or include information like a street address,

11
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,009
multiple phone numbers, a photo,

12
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,002
or any other relevant notes.

13
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:27,006
Here in Microsoft Outlook,

14
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,004
you can add contacts in a couple of different ways.

15
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,003
If you received an email message from someone

16
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,000
and you want to add them to your contacts,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,003
right-click on their email address

18
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:39,002
and choose Add to Outlook Contacts.

19
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,002
In the window that opens, you'll see any details

20
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,000
that Outlook was able to pull from the email

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,003
already filled in here.

22
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:47,002
So we have the full name and email address.

23
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,003
If you have any other info you can fill in other fields,

24
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,005
like the company this person works for, their title,

25
00:00:52,005 --> 00:00:56,003
a web page associated with them, phone numbers,

26
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:57,003
and if you have a photo of them,

27
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:59,004
you can add it by clicking this icon here.

28
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:00,008
You can also use this Notes area

29
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,009
for any other info you may want to remember,

30
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,003
for example, their birthday or the name of their spouse.

31
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,001
When you're done, click Save & Close.

32
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:10,000
And the next time

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,005
you want to send an email to this contact,

34
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,005
just click New Email, start typing their name,

35
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,005
and you'll be able to select them

36
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:17,006
from Outlook's suggestions.

37
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:20,003
I'll just close this for now.

38
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:22,004
Now you can also add contacts from scratch,

39
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:24,007
for example, if someone gives you their business card

40
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,008
and you want to file their contact info in Outlook.

41
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:30,004
Just click the People icon here at the bottom of the window

42
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:33,002
and this is where you'll find your existing contacts.

43
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,009
Click the New Contact button here at the top,

44
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,005
and from here enter any relevant information.

45
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:44,000
So I can type in Jess' name, her job title,

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,007
her email address.

47
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,001
If I have a photo of her, I can click the photo,

48
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,008
and there's her headshot so I'll select that.

49
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:54,006
And I can even add some notes.

50
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:57,009
And, again, when I'm done, I can click Save & Close.

51
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,007
And the next time I need to send an email to Jess,

52
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:02,005
I can just click New Email, start typing her name,

53
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,008
there she is,

54
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,008
and the To field is now filled out.

55
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,006
So that's how to add contacts to your Microsoft Outlook.
