- [Instructor] When you upload files to OneDrive,

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,009
you can securely access, update and share them

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,003
from anywhere you have an internet connection.

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,003
There's several ways to upload files to OneDrive.

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:11,008
Let's take a look at a few of the methods here.

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,002
After signing in to your account,

7
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,007
just click the Upload button in the toolbar,

8
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:18,001
choose to upload files,

9
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,008
and then browse for and select the files you want

10
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:21,003
to copy to OneDrive.

11
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:22,008
In this case, I want to upload all three of these,

12
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:27,000
so I'll just select all three and click Open,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,005
and there are the files.

14
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:30,006
You can also drag files from your computer directly

15
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,006
into the OneDrive browser window.

16
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,001
I'll make the browser window a little bit smaller

17
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:40,000
so I can see my desktop where I have some folders of files.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,009
And again, I can just select the files I want to upload.

19
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:47,009
And in this case, I will drag them into the browser window.

20
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,001
You can see they're uploading and there they are.

21
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,000
If you're using the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,002
you can upload folders of files instead of individual files.

23
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,007
This can make it easier to keep your files organized.

24
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:02,005
Just click the Upload button again,

25
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,005
and this time choose a Folder

26
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:09,009
and then select the folder you want to upload.

27
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,009
I'll confirm that I want to upload the entire folder

28
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:14,009
and here's that folder.

29
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,003
Now, if you're using a browser other than Chrome or Edge,

30
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,003
you can create a new folder first

31
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:22,003
by clicking the New menu and choosing Folder,

32
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:25,005
giving it a name, and then you can upload

33
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:28,000
or drag files into that folder you just created.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,009
I'll click the folder to go into it

35
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,005
and then I move my window out of the way.

36
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:37,001
I'll select my files and I'll drag them

37
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:40,000
into the OneDrive window,

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,008
and there they are.

39
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,009
And once you've uploaded your files to OneDrive,

40
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,003
you can get to them from any computer, tablet

41
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:48,005
or mobile phone with an internet connection.
