00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Instructor] These days, buying products

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:04,008
and services online is pretty easy in most cases

3
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,009
but it can be a little tricky or even scary

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:09,007
if you haven't done it before or very often.

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:12,000
There are lots of reasons to make online purchases.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,004
You might be physically far away from a credible seller

7
00:00:14,004 --> 00:00:16,006
of something you want or maybe you just want to be able

8
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,008
to browse a variety of stores at the same time

9
00:00:18,008 --> 00:00:21,001
to find the best options or prices.

10
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,003
Whatever the reason, online shopping allows you to make

11
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,005
your decisions and purchases quickly and easily

12
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,000
from your computer.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,009
Before going on a website to make a purchase,

14
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:30,008
it's generally a good idea to know what product

15
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:33,001
you're looking for and where you might purchase it

16
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,009
because there are many platforms and sellers

17
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,007
to purchase from online.

18
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,009
It can help to do some online research to find content

19
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:40,009
that can help you decide where to purchase the product

20
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,003
you're looking for.

21
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,008
You can do this by typing the product's name

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,000
into the browser search bar, followed by the word review.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,009
So for example, maybe I'm interested in finding out

24
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,009
about the Microsoft Surface tablet.

25
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:56,004
So I could type Surface tablet review.

26
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:58,002
This can lead you to reviews that are written by others

27
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,005
who have purchased the product or service you're looking for

28
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:02,004
as well as reviews written by professional

29
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,002
and trusted sources.

30
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,004
Combined, these reviews can help you decide if a product

31
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:10,003
or service is reliable and a good fit for your needs.

32
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,001
Once you've determined the product you want to buy

33
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,000
and identified a reliable seller,

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,007
it's time to make the purchase.

35
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:18,002
Many e-commerce websites make it easy to browse products

36
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,008
using categories or to search for specific products

37
00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:24,001
using a search bar or to compare similar items.

38
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,002
If the product you're looking for has available options

39
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,001
like different configurations, colors, or features,

40
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:31,008
you'll find links to manage your preferences.

41
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,000
When you're ready to purchase a product,

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,001
look for a button that's usually labeled buy now

43
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:38,001
or add to cart or something similar.

44
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,004
Just like a physical cart at a physical store,

45
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:42,005
an online shopping cart keeps tracks of products

46
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:45,000
you intend to buy from that site.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,006
So for example, maybe I decided I also

48
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:48,003
want to purchase this mouse.

49
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:50,004
I'll click add to cart.

50
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,004
And if I scroll back up, you can see I now have two items

51
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,004
in my cart.

52
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:55,004
You'll always have the chance to add or remove items

53
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,006
from your cart before you make your purchase.

54
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:00,001
So if I change my mind, I can just click remove.

55
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:02,001
And that takes it out of the cart.

56
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:03,003
Once you've added the products you want,

57
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:05,009
you're ready to check out.

58
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,007
Depending on the shopping website you're using,

59
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,006
you may be required to create an account

60
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,006
before completing your purchase.

61
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,000
As always, be cautious when sharing your information

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,003
to create an account.

63
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,007
Never share personal information other than the shipping

64
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,004
and billing information required to make your purchase.

65
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,000
And look in the address bar of the website

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,007
for this lock icon.

67
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:26,004
That indicates that the site is encrypted and secure.

68
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,004
This means that only the company will be able to view

69
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:30,003
the information you're sending.

70
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:32,007
If you don't see any indication of site security,

71
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:34,009
don't enter any information and consider making

72
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:36,004
your purchase on a different website

73
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,006
that carries the same products.

74
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:40,008
Additionally, it's not a good idea to make purchases

75
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,009
while using a public Wi-Fi network.

76
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:45,000
If possible, wait until you're on your home network

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,005
to make your purchases.

78
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,003
If you have an account with the website you're using,

79
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,007
you can still browse the site while on a public network.

80
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:53,005
And the items you add to your cart will often remain there

81
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,001
when you log into your site again from home

82
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,000
to complete your purchase.

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,003
And after completing your purchase, which involves

84
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:02,005
entering your name, email address, shipping information,

85
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,009
and payment info like your credit card number,

86
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:07,009
you should receive an email confirming your purchase.

87
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,003
Many sites let you then track your order so you can monitor

88
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:12,004
its progress to your location.

89
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:15,002
So that's the basic rundown of making online purchases.

90
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:18,001
When done properly, it can be a convenient way to research

91
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,009
and buy products from your computer.
