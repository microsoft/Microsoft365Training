00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,004
- [Presenter] The internet and the web make it possible

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:03,009
for us to stay connected with friends

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:06,000
and family across the world.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,003
We can use social media and other platforms

5
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,004
to see what's happening in our friends' lives,

6
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:13,009
share personal news and stay in touch with others.

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,005
But sharing things online isn't always safe.

8
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,006
Things you intend to only be shared with friends

9
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,003
could be found and viewed by strangers

10
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,002
in any number of ways.

11
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,001
For example, imagine you've bought a new car,

12
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,004
and you want your friends to see it,

13
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,009
so you post a picture on social media.

14
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:29,005
That might seem fine, but that picture

15
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:32,002
includes a lot of personal information about you.

16
00:00:32,002 --> 00:00:33,009
It tells anyone who sees it what make

17
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,004
and model of car you have.

18
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:38,004
Some people use their car's make and model as passwords.

19
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,007
If you're one of those people,

20
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,006
you've just potentially shared your password,

21
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,009
or maybe part of your password.

22
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,009
If the photo includes your license plate,

23
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:47,007
anyone can see the license plate number

24
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:50,001
and learn what state you live in.

25
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,007
These might seem like minor things,

26
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,004
but the more you share, or inadvertently share,

27
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,009
the easier it is for someone to learn information about you

28
00:00:56,009 --> 00:01:00,001
and build a profile about you, your likes and dislikes,

29
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,003
where you work, how much you earn and so on.

30
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,007
Now, this doesn't mean you should never post

31
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:06,005
or share anything to social media,

32
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,003
but it's important to keep safety and privacy

33
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:11,009
as a top concern when you share things online.

34
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,004
Be sure to review the privacy settings

35
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,001
of your social media accounts.

36
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,008
If your account is set to public,

37
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,006
anyone can see your information and what your share.

38
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:22,001
Instead, you should use the private settings on accounts,

39
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:23,007
so that only your personal connections

40
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,004
can see what you share.

41
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,008
You should also be selective about accepting invitations

42
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:30,002
to connect with people on social media.

43
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:33,001
Most social media platforms have a way for you to accept

44
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,002
and deny requests to have someone be your friend

45
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:37,001
or a follower on the site.

46
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:39,004
Think about whether you know the person in real life

47
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,003
and if you're comfortable

48
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:42,009
with them seeing everything you post on that site.

49
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,007
Usually once you accept someone,

50
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:46,005
they have direct access to your profile

51
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,008
and the things you share.

52
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,001
So make sure you only interact

53
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,002
with people you know and trust.

54
00:01:51,002 --> 00:01:52,009
Bear in mind that even when you can control

55
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,009
who has access to your profiles and accounts,

56
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,004
you can't control what other people do

57
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:58,000
with your information.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,008
Even your friends could download your photos

59
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:02,006
or copy what you've written to share with others.

60
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,008
As a general rule, never share something online

61
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:07,008
that you wouldn't want strangers and the public to see.

62
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,008
And always remember to think before you share.

63
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:13,004
Do you really need to post what you're thinking of posting?

64
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:14,007
Are you posting emotionally,

65
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,000
and will you regret posting it later?

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,002
Keep your safety in mind and make smart choices

67
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:20,007
when sharing things online.
