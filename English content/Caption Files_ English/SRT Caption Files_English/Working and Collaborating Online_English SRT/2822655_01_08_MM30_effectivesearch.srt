00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,003
- [Instructor] Search engines are designed to provide you

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:04,006
with the best results that are most likely relevant

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,007
to your search word or phrase.

4
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,001
They can't always accurately predict

5
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,002
what you're looking for but there are some techniques

6
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:12,005
you can use to make it more likely you'll find what you need

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,006
in the search results.

8
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:16,008
I'm using the Bing search engine, which is the default

9
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,003
search engine here in Microsoft Edge but these rules apply

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,005
for nearly all search engines.

11
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:23,008
First of all, there's no need to enter long sentences

12
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:25,006
or phrases for your search.

13
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,006
So don't type something like how do I bake a chocolate cake.

14
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:31,005
instead, just type chocolate cake.

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,007
And as you can see, those two words give me results

16
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,009
for different recipes, photos of cakes, video lessons

17
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,006
on how to bake chocolate cakes, and so on.

18
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,001
For many types of searches, Bing and other search engines

19
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,004
will offer search suggestions that can help you get

20
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,005
to popular results more quickly.

21
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:48,003
So for example, I want to find out what the weather

22
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:50,006
in San Francisco is like right now.

23
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,009
So I'll come back up to the address bar

24
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,001
and start typing San Francisco.

25
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,007
And as I type, several search suggestions appear

26
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,002
below the search field.

27
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,001
If you see the search term you want to use,

28
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,008
instead of typing out the rest of it,

29
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,004
just use your mouse to click the suggestion.

30
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,007
And that quickly shows me the forecast for San Francisco

31
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:08,004
as the top search result.

32
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:09,009
Let's look at another example.

33
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm looking for a song I heard but I only remember

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,008
a small portion of the lyrics.

35
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:17,003
I'll type those lyrics, plans get in the way,

36
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:20,002
followed by the word lyrics.

37
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:22,005
To narrow down the results, I'll put quotes

38
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:27,005
around the lyrics, followed by lyrics again.

39
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,007
And that will find me lyrics that only have those words

40
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,004
in that order.

41
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:34,000
And in the results, I can see that that phrase is in bold

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,002
for each link, letting me quickly read through to see

43
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,008
if I recognize the song I'm looking for.

44
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,001
You can also take advantage of Bing's

45
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,000
search engine smart features.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,008
For example, I'll type square root of 144.

47
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:50,001
And that not only gives me the correct answer

48
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,003
but this is actually a real working calculator.

49
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:56,005
So I can perform other calculations right from here.

50
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,003
And below that, I can find other search results

51
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:01,002
related to my original search about square roots.

52
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,001
Another smart feature is the language translation.

53
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:09,003
I can type something like say hello in French.

54
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,006
And the first result gives me a direct translation.

55
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,000
And like the calculator, this is a live tool.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,005
So I can type in other words and select

57
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:20,004
other languages to translate.

58
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:23,007
Or maybe I want to see how to say that in German.

59
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,008
And there it is.

60
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:27,000
So there you have several tips for getting more effective

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,006
and useful results from your searches more quickly.
