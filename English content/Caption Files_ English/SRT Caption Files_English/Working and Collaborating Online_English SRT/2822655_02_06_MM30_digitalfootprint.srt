00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] If you use the internet,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,006
you should be aware of your digital footprint.

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,009
Just like physical footprints on a dirt path

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:08,008
that show where someone has been walking,

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,006
your digital footprint is the history

6
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:12,007
of all of your online activity.

7
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:15,008
Any social media posts you make, any websites you visit,

8
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,008
and any information you share online

9
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:20,003
contributes to your digital footprint.

10
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,005
Now, your digital footprint isn't a single item,

11
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:24,003
it's more of the impression and profile

12
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:25,005
that people can build about you

13
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,006
by viewing and following what you've done online

14
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:31,001
across various websites and other online services.

15
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,000
The thing to keep in mind

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,009
is that once you post something online,

17
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,005
you have no guarantee that it can be erased.

18
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:38,000
If you post something on social media

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,007
and then delete it from your account,

20
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,005
other people may have already seen it,

21
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,008
or they might have taken a screenshot of it.

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,002
So the posts and activity

23
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:48,005
that contribute to your digital footprint can last forever.

24
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,007
Now, this can be a good thing if your digital footprint

25
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,005
includes things that give you a positive reputation online

26
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,002
and help you build your personal brand.

27
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,004
Your online history can also help the apps you use

28
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:59,009
to know more about you.

29
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,009
They can use this information to serve you better

30
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:05,001
by adjusting to the things you like and your daily habits.

31
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,002
But they can also use this information in the wrong way

32
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,001
and share it with others.

33
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,002
Keep the following tips in mind when you go online

34
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:13,004
to manage your digital footprint.

35
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:16,000
First, know what your footprint says about you.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,003
People who search for you online

37
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,009
will make judgements about you based on what they find.

38
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:22,004
This can include employers when you apply for a job,

39
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:26,000
or recruiters when you apply for academic programs.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,008
It's important to know

41
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:28,003
what your digital footprint says about you

42
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,000
and how your information is being used.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,008
To see what your personal brand is online,

44
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,007
you can search for yourself.

45
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,002
Search for your name in a search engine

46
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,004
and see what results are displayed.

47
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,008
If these results don't show you what you want,

48
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,003
think about what you share online

49
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:45,002
and what information you allow other people to see.

50
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,004
Secondly, actively manage your privacy settings.

51
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:50,000
You can modify the privacy settings

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,005
of most of the social media sites

53
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:53,006
and online applications you use.

54
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:55,008
This can help you control who sees what you share

55
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:57,001
and what information shows up

56
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,008
when someone searches for you online.

57
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:01,008
Third, manage your cookies.

58
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,008
Cookies are notes given to your web browser

59
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:05,002
as you browse the web.

60
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,005
These cookies help apps track information that they need

61
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,001
while you're using the app.

62
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:11,002
This can help the app work better for you.

63
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:13,008
But this data also contributes to your digital footprint

64
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,007
as it allows other sites to gain information

65
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,005
about the sites you visit and your interests.

66
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,001
You can use the settings in your web browser

67
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,006
to limit or block the use of cookies on certain websites.

68
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:26,002
And fourth, think before you share.

69
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,001
Behave like once you share something online,

70
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:31,006
you can't take it back, because that's often the case.

71
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,008
Make sure you're okay with something

72
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:35,006
being part of your public persona before you share it

73
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:39,001
because your digital footprint can live indefinitely online.

74
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,001
So keep these tips in mind to make sure you're happy

75
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,004
with your digital footprint and how it's used.
