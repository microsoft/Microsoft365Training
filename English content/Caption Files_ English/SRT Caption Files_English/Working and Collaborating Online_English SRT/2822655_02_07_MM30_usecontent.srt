00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,004
- [Instructor] Even though it's become easier and easier

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,009
to access information and content on the web,

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,001
including everything from our favorite songs

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,009
to funny videos, to instructions on how to solve

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,002
a homework problem,

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,006
it's important to be responsible

7
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:15,005
with the information we find online.

8
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,007
When someone posts their original work online,

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,004
they are the owner of that content

10
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,007
and they have certain rights, usually considered copyrights,

11
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:26,000
which allow them to decide how that content is used.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,003
This content includes their words,

13
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:30,008
images, music, videos, and more.

14
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,005
If it's their original content,

15
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,006
they are the copyright owner.

16
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,004
So if, for example, you were putting together

17
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,001
a cookbook to sell online,

18
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,003
but you don't have the photos of food that you need,

19
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:42,001
you might think it's okay to use a search engine

20
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,008
to find photos to illustrate your cookbook.

21
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,007
But in most cases, this is not a fair or responsible way

22
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,008
to use the information you find online

23
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,008
because photos belong to the creators

24
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,004
and can't be used in your own work,

25
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,009
unless the creator specifically grants permission.

26
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:58,003
If you want to use someone else's work

27
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,006
in a product you're selling,

28
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,000
you should always obtain permission

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,003
from the content creator.

30
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:04,006
You might have to pay for a license

31
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,001
to use someone else's content,

32
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,005
or they may offer their content in exchange

33
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,009
for giving them credit in your work.

34
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:13,004
For example, if you use someone's photo in your cookbook,

35
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,006
you would credit the photographer

36
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,004
when publishing their photos in your book.

37
00:01:17,004 --> 00:01:19,000
So even though you can use search engines

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,005
to easily find videos, photos, essays, and so on,

39
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,003
that doesn't give you permission to use them

40
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:26,000
in your own work.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,008
Make sure to do the responsible thing

42
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:30,005
and contact the content creator for permission.

43
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:31,009
It's the ethical thing to do,

44
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,009
and it can also help you avoid legal troubles down the road.
