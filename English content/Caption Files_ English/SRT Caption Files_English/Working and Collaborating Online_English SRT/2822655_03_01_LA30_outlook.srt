are a great way to keep track of meetings

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:08,000
and tasks on your own or with the people you work with.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,009
Unlike traditional paper calendars or date books,

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,008
digital calendar software makes it easy

6
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,002
to keep your schedule synced with other people,

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,006
so if you schedule, reschedule,

8
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,006
or cancel meetings or appointments,

9
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:23,003
everyone's calendar is updated to reflect that information.

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:24,009
There are lots of popular calendar apps

11
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,008

00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,007
Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.

13
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,000
In this chapter, we'll be focusing on Outlook

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,007
because in addition to it being

15
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,009
a professional calendar application,

16
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:40,001
it's also a full fledged email application

17
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,006
and contact manager, so you can easily keep

18
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,008
your appointments and other tasks synced between

19
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,000
yourself and others in one place.
