00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] To be able to easily communicate

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,008
with the people you message and call the most through Skype,

3
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,002
you'll need to add them as contacts.

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:08,004
By adding someone as a contact,

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:11,002
you can quickly see whether they're currently online.

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,009
And if so, you can get in touch with them

7
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:16,005
through text messages or calls with just a couple of clicks.

8
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,005
To add a contact, click in the search bar

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,009
and start typing the person's name.

10
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,004
(keyboard clacking)

11
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,004
If they have a Skype account, they should show up

12
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:26,001
in the list of results here in the Skype directory.

13
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:28,005
Once you've located them, you can right click their name

14
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,003
and choose to add them as a contact.

15
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:32,005
Now, if I clear the search,

16
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,009
you can see with contacts selected,

17
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,000
Oliver has been added to my contacts.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,004
Now you can also search for people by their usernames,

19
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,003
which can be useful if the person you're searching for

20
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:42,000
has a common name, in which case,

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,004
you might see multiple results

22
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:45,000
when you search for them by name.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,002
In those cases, you might want to ask your friend or colleague

24
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,009
what their Skype username is.

25
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,000
Then you can just type that username into the search field.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,001
(keys clacking)

27
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,002
And then you can add them as a contact when they show up.

28
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,008
So that's how to add contacts to your Skype account.
