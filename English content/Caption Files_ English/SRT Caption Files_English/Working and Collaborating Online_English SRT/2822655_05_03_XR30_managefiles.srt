00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] In the OneDrive web interface,

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,007
there are three main areas for helping you

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:06,006
view, work with, and manage your files.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,001
We have the navigation pane over here on the left,

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,001
the toolbar across the top,

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,004
and the file list, which takes up

7
00:00:12,004 --> 00:00:14,003
the majority of the window.

8
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:15,008
You may see slightly different views

9
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:17,003
depending if you're signed into OneDrive

10
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:20,003
with a personal, work, or student account,

11
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,001
but basically, you click any of the categories here

12
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,002
in the navigation pane to determine

13
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:26,001
what you see in the file list area.

14
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,007
Currently, I have My files selected,

15
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,004
so I'm looking at all of my files.

16
00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:31,005
I can click Recent to see the files

17
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,002
I've worked with the most recently,

18
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:37,000
Photos to see the photo stored on my OneDrive account,

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,002
and so on.

20
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:40,009
Up here in the toolbar area,

21
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,004
you can use the search field to search

22
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,009
for files on your OneDrive,

23
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,004
as well as create new folders or documents,

24
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,006
or upload files from your computer to OneDrive.

25
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,003
You can also sort files to make it easier

26
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:53,004
to locate the ones you want to work with.

27
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:54,005
For example, I may want to sort

28
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:58,005
by the most recently modified files.

29
00:00:58,005 --> 00:00:59,005
And you can change the view

30
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,009
of your files from this menu here.

31
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:08,000
I can try a compact list, tiles, or photos.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,004
To work with a file, select it in the file list area,

33
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,003
and then, choose what you'd like

34
00:01:12,003 --> 00:01:14,002
to do with it in the toolbar area.

35
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,007
We can open it, share it, download it, delete it, and so on.

36
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:19,003
The toolbar also lets you check information

37
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:22,006
about your selected file by clicking this info button.

38
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:24,007
For example, if it's a file you have shared with

39
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:26,006
or are collaborating on with others,

40
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,005
you can see who has access to the file

41
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,009
and who last worked on it.

42
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,004
So that's an overview of how to manage

43
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,007
your files in OneDrive.
