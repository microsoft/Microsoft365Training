1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,008
- Thanks to the internet

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,009
we can store information online from one device

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,002
and access it from another device almost instantly.

4
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,003
This is commonly referred to

5
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:12,001
as storing information in the cloud.

6
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,002
The cloud is basically a collection of software services

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,007
that are running in multiple locations on the internet

8
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:20,007
instead of running on a single user's computer.

9
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:22,008
That means that storing content in the cloud,

10
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:26,000
makes it easy to access your information from any device

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,001
in any location where you have internet access.

12
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:31,001
Some cloud-based services you might've heard of

13
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:34,003
include Dropbox, Apple's iCloud drive,

14
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:37,006
Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive.

15
00:00:37,006 --> 00:00:40,005
So for example, instead of saving your important documents

16
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,002
and other files to your computer,

17
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:43,009
you can save them to OneDrive,

18
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,008
which will allow you to get to them from anywhere.

19
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,005
This means that if you're working on a file

20
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,006
on your home computer and save it to OneDrive,

21
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:53,004
and later you're on the road with only your mobile phone,

22
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:55,003
you can still access and download that file

23
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,004
through OneDrive on your phone.

24
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,001
In this chapter, we'll take a look at how to save

25
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,000
and access files from OneDrive,

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but you'll find that the process of doing so

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,009
is very similar to working with other cloud-based services.
