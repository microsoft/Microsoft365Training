1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] There are several types of media

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,005
that many of us come across on a daily basis.

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,007
These include traditional media like newspapers, magazines,

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,006
books, TV, and radio,

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,007
but also relatively newer forms of media,

6
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:15,000
like email, web articles, social media posts,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,006
and a lot more.

8
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,005
We're constantly being inundated by media

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,000
that wants our attention.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,006
It's easy to become overwhelmed by the flow of information,

11
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:25,000
if we don't develop the skills to navigate our way

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,004
through the ocean of information that surrounds us everyday

13
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:31,000
and learn to evaluate information with a critical eye.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,009
Each year companies spend large sums of money

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,004
on internet advertising,

16
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,003
to the point where the line between information

17
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,007
and advertisements becomes blurred.

18
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:40,006
Other media can be filled with the attitudes

19
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,008
and opinions of others,

20
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,008
while other forms of media hide their message

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,004
under the surface of what we see and hear.

22
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,001
So it's important to develop media literacy

23
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,000
in order to avoid just passively accepting all messages

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,005
and instead learn to think carefully and critically

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,007
about the media we consume.

26
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,003
Here are five basic questions you can ask

27
00:00:58,003 --> 00:00:59,009
when you encounter new information

28
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,003
and once you determine its accuracy and reliability.

29
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:05,009
Question one, who created the message?

30
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,005
Knowing who created the message,

31
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:10,003
may give you some insight in their purposes for doing so.

32
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,004
Was it to sell you something, to promote something

33
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:16,003
or was it to genuinely share information?

34
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:19,001
It's difficult to have a completely unbiased perspective,

35
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:21,003
but it's important to determine if the bias outweighs

36
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,004
or influences the information

37
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,002
and asking who created the message

38
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,005
can help give you the distance to see the information

39
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,009
being presented more clearly.

40
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,002
Question two, what techniques are being used

41
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:34,000
to capture your attention?

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,004
Is information being presented in a colorful video

43
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:37,008
with happy music?

44
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:39,007
Is it being delivered in ominous tones

45
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:42,001
with sensationalist phrasing?

46
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,005
The way the message is being presented

47
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:44,007
can have a big influence

48
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,000
on how you perceive that information.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,001
Question three, how might different people

50
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,000
interpret this message?

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,003
We all consume information a little differently,

52
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:55,008
and it's important to step outside our own perspective

53
00:01:55,008 --> 00:01:57,008
to explore multiple viewpoints.

54
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,004
Some information you come across may not take into account

55
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:03,001
the perspective and experience of others.

56
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,008
Question four is what's being left out of the message?

57
00:02:05,008 --> 00:02:08,001
What points of view lifestyles or values

58
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,006
are being expressed in or alternately left out

59
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,001
of the message?

60
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,001
When making a message,

61
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,000
the author makes choices about what to keep in

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,004
and what to leave out.

63
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,002
And these choices

64
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:19,009
can reflect the author's values and attitudes.

65
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,009
Are certain perspectives being deliberately left out

66
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:24,006
of the message to influence your opinion?

67
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,009
And question five, why is this message being sent?

68
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:30,005
The purpose of this question is to examine the motivation

69
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:32,006
of sending the message in the first place.

70
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:33,006
It goes beyond the idea

71
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:36,001
that media is just there to entertain and inform

72
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,001
and asks who benefits from this message?

73
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,009
These five questions are not the only questions

74
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:43,003
you can and should ask when evaluating media,

75
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:45,002
but they can provide the necessary foundation

76
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:46,006
to start thinking critically

77
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,008
about the media we engage with every day.
