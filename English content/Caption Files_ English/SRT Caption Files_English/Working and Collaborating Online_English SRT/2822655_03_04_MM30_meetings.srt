1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] You can use Outlook to keep track

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,000
of your personal appointments

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,009
as well as schedule meetings with other people.

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,009
In Outlook, switch to the calendar view

5
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,009
by clicking this icon in the navigation area

6
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,008
at the bottom of the window.

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,009
I'm currently viewing my calendar by the month,

8
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,004
but you can click the options in the ribbon

9
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:18,009
under the Home tab to also be your calendar by day,

10
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:22,000
the workweek, or the entire week as well.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll switch back to the month view for now.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,008
Start by selecting the date of the appointment

13
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,001
or meeting you want to add to your calendar.

14
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:31,000
Then, you can click New Appointment or New Meeting.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,004
The difference between an appointment

16
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:35,000
and a meeting is that you can invite others to meetings

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,007
and appointments are generally events

18
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:39,008
you'll attend on your own or without inviting others.

19
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll choose New Appointment.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,007
Here, enter the title of your appointment,

21
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,004
and because we selected the date first,

22
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,001
it should already be filled out correctly

23
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:49,005
in the start time area,

24
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,007
but you can change it here if necessary.

25
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:54,003
Then, select the time of the appointment

26
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,004
and then, enter the end time

27
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,006
to block off that time on your calendar.

28
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:01,000
You can also select All day to designate

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,006
the appointment as an all day event,

30
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,005
rather than taking place at a specific time.

31
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:09,003
I'll uncheck that for now, and then, click Save & Close.

32
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:11,005
And now, that appointment is on my calendar.

33
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,003
Adding a meeting is very similar.

34
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,003
Just click the date of the meeting

35
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,005
and then, click New Meeting.

36
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,004
Again, enter a title.

37
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,007
In the Required area, you'll add the names of people

38
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:24,008
who are required to attend this meeting.

39
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:27,000
If you've previously created a contact group,

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,002
you can type the group's name here.

41
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:31,002
You can also enter the contact info for people

42
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:33,008
for whom the meeting is optional.

43
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:37,006
If necessary, you can add other details like the location.

44
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:39,005
Then, click Send.

45
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:41,003
That adds the appointment to your calendar

46
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,009
and also emails the meeting invite

47
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,001
and details to the contacts you added.

48
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,005
So that's how to set up appointments

49
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,000
and meetings in Outlook.
