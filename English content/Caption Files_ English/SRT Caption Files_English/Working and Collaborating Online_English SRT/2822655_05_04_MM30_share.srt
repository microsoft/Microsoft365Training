00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] OneDrive is a useful resource

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,009
for storing files that you want to share

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:05,008
or distribute to others.

4
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,007
Even with the default amount of storage space

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,005
you get with a free OneDrive account,

6
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:11,003
you can share much larger files than you could

7
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:13,006
by sending them over e-mail.

8
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:15,006
Sharing a file with others from OneDrive

9
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:17,003
is a simple matter of generating a link

10
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,001
that you can send to them.

11
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,008
Start by selecting the file you want to share

12
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,006
from your file list,

13
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:25,003
then in the toolbar, click the Share button.

14
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,001
In this Send link area that opens,

15
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,006
you can enter the e-mail addresses

16
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:30,007
of the people you want to share the file with,

17
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:32,008
to have Microsoft automatically send an e-mail

18
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:35,002
with a link to that file when you click Send.

19
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:38,008
Alternately, you can generate a link by clicking Copy Link,

20
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,009
and that creates a link you can copy it to your clipboard

21
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,008
by clicking Copy.

22
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,004
And then you're free to paste that address

23
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,004
into an e-mail you're composing yourself

24
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,004
or into an instant messaging program

25
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,006
or a webpage you're publishing, and so on.

26
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:52,003
For example, I've already started composing

27
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:56,003
an e-mail message in Microsoft Outlook,

28
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:59,009
and here I'll just right click and choose Paste

29
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,003
to paste in that address.

30
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:02,009
And once I'm done, I can click Send

31
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,007
to send the e-mail containing this link,

32
00:01:04,007 --> 00:01:07,002
and my recipient will be able to click that link

33
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:09,005
to download the file to her own computer.

34
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:10,008
So that's a look at how easy it is

35
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,004
to share files from OneDrive.
