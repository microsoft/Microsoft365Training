1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,007
- [Instructor] If you often email the same group of people,

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,005
for example, your team at work,

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,003
instead of having to create an email and adding each person

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,007
as a recipient individually each time,

5
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:11,006
you can create a contact group,

6
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,004
so you'll only need to type the group's name,

7
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:16,000
to email everyone in that group.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,005
To do this in Microsoft Outlook,

9
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:18,007
start by going to your contacts

10
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:22,001
by clicking the People button here in the navigation bar

11
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,000
and with the Home tab selected,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,005
click the arrow next to New Contact

13
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,006
and choose Contact Group.

14
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:31,007
In this window that opens, enter a name for the group.

15
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:32,009
I'll call this staff instructors

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,007
to include everyone on my team,

17
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:36,003
then click Add Members.

18
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,002
From here you can choose to add existing contacts,

19
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,005
you have an Outlook from your address book,

20
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,002
or you can choose New Email Contact

21
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:44,007
to manually enter contact information.

22
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:47,007
For this example, I'll choose From Outlook Contacts.

23
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,007
And from here, I can double kick the names of the people

24
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,003
in my contacts that I want to add to this group.

25
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:56,001
Once I'm done there, I can click Okay.

26
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,003
You can say they've been added here

27
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,006
and I can click Save and Close.

28
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:02,002
So now anytime I want to send an email

29
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:04,004
to all three of those contacts,

30
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,009
I can just create a new email

31
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,004
and in the To field, start typing staff instructors,

32
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,009
select it, and this email will be sent

33
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,003
to everyone in this group.
