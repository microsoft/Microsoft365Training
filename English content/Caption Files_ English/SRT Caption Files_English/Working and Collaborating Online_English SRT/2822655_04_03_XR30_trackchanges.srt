00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] Microsoft Word's ability

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,004
to track changes allows you to freely make edits

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,000
to a document and your collaborators will be able to see

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
exactly what changes you made.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,009
Start by going to the Review tab

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,002
and here click Track Changes.

7
00:00:13,002 --> 00:00:15,004
With that enabled, Word will track any changes

8
00:00:15,004 --> 00:00:17,009
you or anyone else makes to the document.

9
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,005
So for example, I might highlight some text here

10
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,000
and make that bold.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,001
I see a misspelling down here, which I'll fix,

12
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,004
changing that A to an O.

13
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:30,008
And maybe down here I will create a new paragraph.

14
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,001
To review changes made to the document,

15
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,005
you can come back to the Review tab

16
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,006
and notice here we have this menu

17
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:38,000
that's currently set to Simple Markup.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,007
We have several options here.

19
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,003
The Simple Markup option indicates

20
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:44,000
where changes have been made with a red line in the margin.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,001
So you might've noticed that as I made my changes,

22
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,009
these red lines appeared.

23
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:52,006
All Markup shows the edits with a blue highlight,

24
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:55,003
and you can actually see the changes here in the document.

25
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,006
Now, in this first case at the top,

26
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,000
you can see that the change

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,001
is that the font was changed to bold.

28
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,001
Down here you can see that the A was deleted

29
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,005
and the O was typed in its place.

30
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,007
And here we can see another line

31
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:09,000
indicating a paragraph break.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There's also the option here of No Markup,

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,005
which hides all the markups

34
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,009
and shows you what the changes will look like

35
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:15,009
in the document.

36
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,000
And Original shows the document in its original form

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,002
without the changes,

38
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:22,000
which can be useful for comparing the original

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,006
with the edited version.

40
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:24,009
Additionally, when you're viewing an option

41
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,001
that displays the markups,

42
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,000
you can use the Show Markup menu here

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
to specify which types of revisions you want to see.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,008
So for example,

45
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,007
if you only wanted to see formatting changes,

46
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:37,005
you could uncheck everything but that option.

47
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,003
And now you can see, I'm only seeing the change here,

48
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:41,003
where I changed this text to bold,

49
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,006
but if I want to see the other changes

50
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:44,008
I can add Insert and Deletions back,

51
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:47,005
and if I have comments, I can see those as well.

52
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,002
So, that's how to track changes to documents in Word.
