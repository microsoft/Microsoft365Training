00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,008
- [Narrator] The internet and social media platforms

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:05,001
allow us to connect with our friends, family,

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,006
and peers in a variety of ways.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,001
It's a great way to keep in touch,

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,006
but sometimes people take advantage of these platforms

6
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:15,000
and use them to spread negative messages about others.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,004
Cyberbullying or bullying that takes place on the internet

8
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:21,002
can be just as bad as bullying in person.

9
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,004
People can use the internet to send hurtful messages

10
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:25,006
to someone, spread fake rumors

11
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:29,000
or share someone's private information without permission.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,004
The results of cyberbullying can be just as impacting

13
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:33,007
as face to face bullying.

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,000
When someone is cyberbullied,

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,006
their feelings can be hurt

16
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:39,000
and their reputation can be damaged.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can't always prevent cyberbullying,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,005
but you can play a part in making the internet a friendlier

19
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,008
and safer place for everyone.

20
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,005
Here's some guidelines you can follow

21
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:50,000
to promote civility online.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,007
First, simply avoid sending negative messages

23
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:55,009
and participating in behavior that can hurt someone else.

24
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:57,002
Respect differences.

25
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,000
When you interact with people online,

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,005
respect their differences in opinion, experience

27
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:02,008
and culture.

28
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:04,002
Even if you don't agree with something

29
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,000
that another person shares online,

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,008
you should still treat them with respect

31
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:09,004
and make the internet a friendly place

32
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:11,009
for communication and discussion.

33
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,001
Think about the consequences of sharing.

34
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,003
Before you share or post anything online,

35
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:19,008
always pause and think about the consequences of doing so.

36
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,007
Will your message hurts someone else?

37
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,008
Will it damage your reputation or the safety

38
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,009
or reputation of others?

39
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,005
Does it contribute anything constructive

40
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:29,003
to the conversation?

41
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:31,000
If you feel unsafe online,

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,007
you should feel comfortable to remove yourself

43
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:35,007
from a situation and report it to someone you trust.

44
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,004
There is no rule requiring you to engage in conversations

45
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,007
or arguments with people online.

46
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:43,008
And when you do see cruel or dangerous activity online,

47
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,004
offer to support those involved

48
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:48,004
and report the incident to someone you trust.

49
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:50,003
We can all play a part in being responsible,

50
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:53,002
digital citizens online in making the internet a safe

51
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,000
and friendly place for everyone.
