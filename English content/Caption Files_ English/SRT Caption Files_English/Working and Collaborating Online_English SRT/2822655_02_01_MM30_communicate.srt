1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
- The internet offers a multitude of ways to communicate

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,008
and stay in touch with others.

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:09,004
This includes services like email, instant messaging,

4
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:12,002
website discussion boards, social media,

5
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,007
and even voice and video calls.

6
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,001
On top of learning how to use these various methods

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,001
of communication, it's also important

8
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:22,001
to understand when to use them.

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:24,002
For example, if you need to ask a coworker

10
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:27,000
a question that requires a time sensitive reply,

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,008
email might not be the best choice

12
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:30,007
as not everyone checks their email regularly

13
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:32,003
throughout the day.

14
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,009
Instead, your company may use an instant messaging service,

15
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:37,003
like Skype or Google Hangouts or Slack,

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,009
and sending a text-based message through that service

17
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,001
may get you a quicker reply.

18
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,004
In situations where you can wait a reasonable amount of time

19
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,008
for a reply, email is a better choice

20
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:49,001
as the general expectation is that email

21
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:51,008
is not for back and forth conversation in real-time,

22
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,009
but instead lets each person be a little more thoughtful

23
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,007
about their words and the information they're sharing.

24
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:58,007
Email is also useful to have a written record

25
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:00,002
of your conversations.

26
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,000
And of course, for real-time conversations,

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,006
when you can't be in the same room,

28
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,008
you have the option of traditional phone calls

29
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:07,004
or even video-based calls,

30
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:10,006
so you can both see and hear people in real-time.

31
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:12,007
Video calls can make it a little easier to communicate

32
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:15,002
effectively because they allow you to see the expressions

33
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:17,009
on the attendees faces during the call.

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,000
So again, understanding when to use certain types

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,006
of services is an important aspect of communicating online.
