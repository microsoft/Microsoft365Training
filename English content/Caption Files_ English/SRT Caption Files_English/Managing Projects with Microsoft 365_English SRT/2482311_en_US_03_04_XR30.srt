00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] Once you create a project,

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,003
The next step is to add tasks.

3
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,007
I've found the easiest way

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:07,006
is to think of the big pieces first,

5
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:11,000
and then fill in the details later.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,003
In this lesson,

7
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,002
you'll be able to use Microsoft Project

8
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,004
to add tasks, assigned tasks,

9
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,001
and set start and end dates.

10
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,000
In this example,

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'll create a client wedding project.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,008
I'll start from Office.com

13
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:26,000
Select the app launcher

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,001
in the top-left corner and open Project.

15
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,001
Note that using Project for the web

16
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,006
requires an active subscription

17
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:35,005
to Microsoft Project.

18
00:00:35,005 --> 00:00:40,006
Next, I'll select new blank project.

19
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,003
On the Project main page,

20
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:44,001
you can see the project name,

21
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:48,002
and three options for grid, board and timeline.

22
00:00:48,002 --> 00:00:49,009
And on the right there's filters,

23
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,009
and group members and more actions.

24
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,005
Grid view shows the list of tasks

25
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,009
for the project and the common task properties.

26
00:00:57,009 --> 00:01:02,005
Name, quick look, assigned to and duration.

27
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,000
To rename the project,

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,009
I'll select untitled project

29
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,005
in the upper-left corner,

30
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:12,001
and I'll enter client wedding.

31
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,002
I'll set the start date

32
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:18,008
to the first day of next month.

33
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,007
Select the X in the upper right corner

34
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:24,007
to close.

35
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,000
Next, I'll add some tasks by selecting

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,008
add new task and name them.

37
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll now switch to the board view

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,001
by selecting board in the top menu,

39
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,001
and I can see all the tasks are in bucket one.

40
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll select bucket one to rename this bucket

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,001
to catering.

42
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,003
I'll then add another bucket for venue

43
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:58,001
by selecting add bucket.

44
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,009
I'll drag the venue-related tasks

45
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,007
into the venue bucket.

46
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:07,001
Now that the project buckets are set with tasks,

47
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,006
I can assign them to members of my team.

48
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:11,003
First, I'll switch back to grid view

49
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:15,002
by selecting grid on the top.

50
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,005
Now I can assign tasks

51
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,006
using the assigned to column.

52
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:20,005
For the finalized venue task,

53
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,003
I'll select the assigned to column,

54
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:23,005
and enter Isaiah,

55
00:02:23,005 --> 00:02:34,006
and select them from the dropdown list.

56
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,007
A dialogue appears

57
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,007
asking whether I want to add Isaiah

58
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,001
to the project group.

59
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,000
Select add a group,

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,003
then select create and assign.

61
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,009
I'll assign identify a caterer to Lynne

62
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:49,005
by entering her name in the assigned to column,

63
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:58,004
and selecting assign and add.

64
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,009
The next I need to add

65
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:02,006
is the duration of each task.

66
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,005
The duration is how long I expect

67
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:06,000
the task to take.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,004
I'll select the duration column

69
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:09,002
for the have a tasting task,

70
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:12,001
and enter one to set the duration to one day.

71
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:18,009
I'll do the same for the other tasks.

72
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,008
Now, when I go back to the board view,

73
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:22,002
I see each task,

74
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,003
who it's assigned to,

75
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,001
and the number of days to complete.

76
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:29,003
Next, I want to set the start dates.

77
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:31,005
Select timeline on the top menu,

78
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,000
and notice that each task

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,002
begins on the first day of next month.

80
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:36,009
And that the length of the box

81
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,007
is set by the duration I entered.

82
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:42,009
I can drag each task to the correct start date,

83
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,007
or select it and enter it in the start field,

84
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:52,008
and select X in the upper-right corner to save.

85
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,008
Before you start your next project,

86
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:57,001
explore how project can map your tasks,

87
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:59,001
and help you collaborate with your team.
