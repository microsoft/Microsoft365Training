00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] It's natural that, over time,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,004
a plan will evolve and change.

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,006
Plans are living documents.

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,004
In this lesson, I'll show you how

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:11,004
to communicate changes using Microsoft Planner.

6
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:14,002
From office.com in the top left corner,

7
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:21,003
I'll select the app launcher, then open Planner.

8
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,004
I'll start by opening the June wedding plan

9
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:27,000
that I've been working on.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,008
Select More on the top menu then, choose Plan Settings.

11
00:00:34,008 --> 00:00:36,005
First, I can update my plan to have

12
00:00:36,005 --> 00:00:43,003
a different background, I'll select this one.

13
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:49,003
Next, select Notifications.

14
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,009
In the bottom section, I can see that Planner

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:55,006
is already sending me individual notifications for my tasks.

16
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:58,004
I want to increase transparency across my team,

17
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:01,000
and make everyone aware when tasks are completed.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,002
Since I'm the group owner in the Group Email setting

19
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:06,003
I'll select Send email to the group

20
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:14,001
when a task is assigned or completed, then select Save.

21
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,003
Joni just notified me that the marriage license

22
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:22,004
has been obtained, I'll mark that task as complete.

23
00:01:22,004 --> 00:01:23,009
Now, the whole team will receive

24
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,007
an email and we can notify the client.

25
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:30,004
Finally, I can share my public plan across my organization.

26
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,007
I'm onboarding a new hire and I want them

27
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:35,000
to be able to see what the team is working on.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,005
I can select More and, in the dropdown,

29
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:42,009
choose Copy link to plan.

30
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,005
The link is copied to my clipboard.

31
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:47,005
I can now send it in a Teams message or email.

32
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:50,000
By creating visibility across plans,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,005
your team can be even more effective.

34
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:54,003
Consider turning on notifications

35
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:55,007
and sharing your next plan.
