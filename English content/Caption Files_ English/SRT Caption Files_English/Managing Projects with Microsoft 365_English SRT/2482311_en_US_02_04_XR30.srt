00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,009
- [Instructor] Whether you're planning

2
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:03,003
a family get-together, business event,

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,004
or a work project, you should organize and keep track

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:09,002
of your work by breaking it down into tasks.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to manage tasks

6
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:14,007
in Planner and how to organize everyone's tasks

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,008
to make sure the project is successful.

8
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:19,002
I'll start from office.com.

9
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,008
Select the app launcher in the top left corner

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:26,008
and open Planner.

11
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:29,000
I'll start by opening the June wedding plan

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,008
that I've been working on.

13
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:34,004
I've added a few due dates ahead of time.

14
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,000
When you are assigned to a project,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,008
the first thing you want to know is what's assigned to you.

16
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,001
The different group views are designed to help.

17
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,005
In the upper right, it says the plan is grouped by bucket.

18
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:47,007
This is a good view to use when you need to add new tasks.

19
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,003
In the dropdown, choose Assigned To to see what's assigned

20
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:55,000
to each person and the due date of each item.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,007
Joni told me they need additional help to accomplish

22
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,000
their task of mailing invitations.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,007
I can assign a second person to this task by selecting it,

24
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:13,000
selecting Assign To, and adding Isaiah.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,009
Now the tasks show up in both of their lists.

26
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:19,000
To see your project status, you can switch to chart view

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,002
by selecting Charts in the top center.

28
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:24,002
Chart view gives a high level overview

29
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,001
of how the project is progressing.

30
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:27,006
This view shows the task count

31
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,006
and the progress of each task.

32
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,004
You can see the number of tasks by priority, bucket,

33
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:39,007
and number of tasks assigned to each member.

34
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,007
When I'm working on a big project,

35
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:43,005
there are times when I need to see the tasks

36
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:46,003
in a calendar view so I like to use schedule view.

37
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:50,008
Select Schedule on the top menu next to Charts.

38
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:52,009
Here you can see the tasks for the month,

39
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:54,009
along with due dates and status.

40
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,008
I'll go ahead and set the start date for a task.

41
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,002
I'll select Plan the rehearsal dinner

42
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,000
and in the start date dropdown select one week

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,009
before the due date.

44
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:10,009
Then close the dialogue.

45
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,008
Planner now shows the dates this task is being worked on.

46
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,007
I can easily move the date by dragging it

47
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:20,001
to the desired date.

48
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:23,003
Alternatively, I can drag the right edge to increase

49
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:34,002
and decrease the length of time for this task.

50
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:36,008
The schedule view is also great for adding new tasks

51
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:39,002
and assigning them to a due date in one step.

52
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's say this client selected a venue

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,006
that did not include a caterer.

54
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:45,009
I'll select add task on the right, enter a name,

55
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:53,007
select Caterer, and add it to the four to six months bucket.

56
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,004
Select Add Task.

57
00:02:56,004 --> 00:03:02,003
From here, I can drag this task to the date that it's due.

58
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:04,005
Seeing what needs to be accomplished by when

59
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:07,003
and by who is key when it comes to projects.

60
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,006
With all the different views available in Planner,

61
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,007
your team can view all the right information

62
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,008
at the right time.
