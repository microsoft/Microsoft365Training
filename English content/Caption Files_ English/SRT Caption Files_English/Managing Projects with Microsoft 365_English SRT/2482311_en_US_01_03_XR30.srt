00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,001
- [Instructor] Think of a project

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,007
you've been wanting to start.

3
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,004
No matter what the project is,

4
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,003
there's no better place to put ideas down than with a list.

5
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,009
Your brain is already full of information.

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,009
Let lists help keep your project organized.

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:17,006
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create your first list.

8
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,008
In this example, I'm going to use lists to track my budget

9
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,006
for a client of my wedding planning business.

10
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:27,002
To get started, in the top left corner of office.com,

11
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:31,003
I'll select the app launcher and open lists.

12
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:35,008
To create a new list, I'll select new list.

13
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:38,005
This dialogue allows you to create a blank list,

14
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:42,002
a list from Excel or from an existing list.

15
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:45,005
I can also create a list from a template.

16
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,009
None of these templates are exactly what I want

17
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,002
so I'll create a blank list.

18
00:00:52,002 --> 00:00:56,000
For the name, I'll enter wedding planning budget.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And for the description,

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,008
I'll enter new client wedding planning budget.

21
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:04,005
I will leave the color and icon as a default settings

22
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:06,007
but you can change them if you want to.

23
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:10,003
I'll save this new list to my list so I can find it later.

24
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:16,008
These details look good to me so I can now select create.

25
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:20,004
By default, a list starts with a single column named title.

26
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,009
I'll rename the title column to item

27
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,003
by selecting the dropdown arrow next to title

28
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:31,001
and then select column settings and rename.

29
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:36,009
I'll enter item and then select save.

30
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:40,004
I'll use this column to enter the item I need to budget

31
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:45,002
like a photographer, a florist and a venue.

32
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,006
But just knowing the things I need to budget

33
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,008
isn't quite enough information.

34
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll use a budget column

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,004
to record how much each item should cost.

36
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,007
I'll also need a column to record how much was spent.

37
00:01:57,007 --> 00:02:01,005
This way, we can see if the client is on budget or not.

38
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:05,000
To add another column I'll select add column.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,005
Lists have several standard column types.

40
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:11,001
I'll choose currency then I'll name it budget

41
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:17,001
and select save.

42
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,000
And now I'll create the actual expense column.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,002
Again, I'll select add column, select currency

44
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:28,004
and I'll name this column actual.

45
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,006
Select save and there it is.

46
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:34,002
Now that I have the column set up, I can enter in the budget

47
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:35,004
for each vendor.

48
00:02:35,004 --> 00:02:37,008
I will add my first budget item by selecting new

49
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:40,004
in the top left corner.

50
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:42,008
I will enter a title for the item photographer

51
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:45,006
and add a budget of $1,200.

52
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:47,003
I haven't purchased this yet,

53
00:02:47,003 --> 00:02:50,008
so I will leave the actual field blank.

54
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:54,003
I can then select save to add the photographer.

55
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,007
We've already paid for the venue.

56
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:59,008
So I'll select new, name the item venue

57
00:02:59,008 --> 00:03:04,006
and then enter $5,000 in the budget box.

58
00:03:04,006 --> 00:03:08,004
We actually spent $5,225

59
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:12,005
so I'll enter that in the actual expense box

60
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:14,009
then save the item.

61
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,004
If I need to see the columns in a different order,

62
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:18,004
I can reorder them

63
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:21,008
by dragging the column to where I want it.

64
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:24,006
I'd like to see the actuals before the budget

65
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:27,007
so I can drag the column before budget.

66
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,002
And that's it.

67
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:31,002
Try moving a project that you're currently tracking

68
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,002
on paper into lists.

69
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:35,007
It can help you supercharge your project.

70
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,005
Think about an upcoming project deadline

71
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:40,002
and try building it out in Microsoft lists.

72
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,002
You're on your way to staying organized.
