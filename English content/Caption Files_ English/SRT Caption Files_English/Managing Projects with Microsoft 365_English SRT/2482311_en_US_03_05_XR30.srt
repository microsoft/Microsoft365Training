00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,007
- [Instructor] Big projects are achievable

2
00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,000
when you've broken them down into smaller tasks

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,006
and have added dependencies

4
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:08,002
to see what needs to be done first.

5
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:11,008
In this lesson, I'll use an example client wedding project

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,001
to show how to add subtasks and dependencies

7
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,006
in Microsoft Project

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,006
so that you can stay on top of all the details.

9
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,004
I'll start from office.com.

10
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,008
Select the app launcher in the top left corner

11
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:25,000
and open Project.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,006
Note that using Project for the web

13
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:29,007
requires an active subscription to Microsoft Project.

14
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:33,007
I'll open the Client wedding project.

15
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,007
I'm in grid view by default.

16
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:38,005
From here, I can start to break down some of these tasks

17
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,007
into smaller subtasks.

18
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:44,005
For example, I have Identify a caterer as a task,

19
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:47,007
but I know there are subtasks associated with this item.

20
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,004
I will add the subtasks.

21
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,004
First, I'll add Determine allergies as a task

22
00:00:52,004 --> 00:00:58,006
by selecting Add new task at the bottom.

23
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:00,001
Place your cursor to the left

24
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,004
of the newly created task number.

25
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:07,008
Then drag the task below the Identify a caterer task.

26
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,006
Now to make Determine allergies a subtask,

27
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:17,005
I'll select More options and choose Make subtask.

28
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:19,001
I'll add one more subtask

29
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:27,008
and drag it below Determine allergies.

30
00:01:27,008 --> 00:01:29,007
I'll assign these tasks to Lynne.

31
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:32,006
Select the Assigned to column for Determine allergies

32
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:34,009
and enter Lynne.

33
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:41,000
And in the Duration column, enter 5 days.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,005
Repeat these steps for Finalize budget,

35
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:47,001
but instead enter 2 days.

36
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,009
Notice that the Identify a caterer task Duration

37
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,009
is now automatically set to 5 days,

38
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,007
since the larger Duration of the two subtasks is 5 days.

39
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,004
These tasks are dependent on each other,

40
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:02,005
meaning that one of the tasks needs to be completed

41
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,004
before the next task can be started.

42
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:08,007
In this case, Determining allergies must happen

43
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,008
before the budget can be finalized.

44
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:14,001
To create dependencies, I'll select Open details

45
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,000
on the Finalize budget subtask.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,003
In the Depends on section, select Add dependency,

47
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:24,002
then choose Determine allergies.

48
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:28,009
Close the task panel by selecting the X in the top right.

49
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:31,002
Notice that the Duration for Identify a caterer

50
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:35,002
changed to 7 days, since Finalize budget can't start

51
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:38,004
until the Determine allergies task is complete.

52
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:41,008
You now have two more tools to manage your projects.

53
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,008
Use subtasks when you need to break down larger work items

54
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:46,003
into smaller tasks,

55
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:49,007
and dependencies to identify when tasks can't start

56
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:52,000
before another is completed.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,001
Try out subtasks and dependencies

58
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:56,003
to help you organize your next project.
