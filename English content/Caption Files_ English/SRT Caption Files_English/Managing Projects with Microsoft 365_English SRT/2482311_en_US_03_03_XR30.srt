00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] As a project manager,

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,007
you'll likely use one of the two common

3
00:00:03,007 --> 00:00:05,007
project management processes,

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,003
Waterfall and Agile.

5
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:09,006
In this lesson,

6
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,007
I'll show you how to use Microsoft Project

7
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:15,001
to quickly create a framework for your projects.

8
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,007
First, Waterfall is a commonly used

9
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:19,006
project management process.

10
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,002
In Waterfall projects,

11
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,002
each phase is dependent on the completion

12
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,000
of the previous phase.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So when mapped out, it looks like a waterfall.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,001
Another project management process is Agile.

15
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,009
In the Agile methodology,

16
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,001
a project is broken down into segments called sprints,

17
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,003
which are small cycles to complete top priority tasks

18
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:41,004
from a backlog of work.

19
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,009
The backlog is the full list of all tasks

20
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,004
that need to be completed for project success.

21
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,002
I'll start from office.com,

22
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:51,009
select the app launcher in the top left corner,

23
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,006
and open Project.

24
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:55,006
Note that using Project for the web

25
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:59,005
requires an active subscription to Microsoft Project.

26
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,001
To set up the framework for an Agile project,

27
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:07,008
I'll create a new project by selecting New Blank Project.

28
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll select the project name and rename it to Wardrobe.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,001
I'll set the start date to be the first day of next month,

30
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:25,004
then close the panel using the X in the top right.

31
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:28,001
Then, I'll select Board view at the top.

32
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:35,005
I'll select Bucket 1 and rename it to Backlog.

33
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:37,004
Next, I'll select Add bucket,

34
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:40,000
and enter Week 1 and Week 2

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
as the names for the next two buckets.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,001
Now I'll enter some items in my backlog.

37
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,001
I'll select add task under Backlog,

38
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:55,002
and enter choose color scheme.

39
00:01:55,002 --> 00:02:13,003
Select Add task, and continue until all tasks are added.

40
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:17,004
Now drag the highest priority tasks to the Week 1 bucket.

41
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,003
This will be our first sprint.

42
00:02:20,003 --> 00:02:23,002
Everything is dependent on choosing the color scheme,

43
00:02:23,002 --> 00:02:24,007
so that will be first.

44
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:26,006
Then I'll drag over a few more tasks

45
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:32,009
that belong in Week 1.

46
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:35,005
Microsoft Project can be used as a framework

47
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:38,003
for many project management processes.

48
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:40,007
As you manage more and more projects,

49
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:42,006
you'll soon discover which processes

50
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:44,000
best suit your workflow.
