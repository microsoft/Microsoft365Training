00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,003
- [Instructor] Have you ever used Excel

2
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:03,000
to track a project?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,004
With Microsoft Lists,

4
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,003
you can save time by creating a list

5
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,007
from an existing Excel document.

6
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,009
In this lesson,

7
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,003
I'll show you how to import

8
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:14,001
your existing data into Lists.

9
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,006
I'll start from Office.com.

10
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:18,002
Select the app launcher in the upper-left corner,

11
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,002
and open Lists.

12
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:21,002
In this example,

13
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:22,006
I have a spreadsheet I've been using

14
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,002
for my wedding planning business,

15
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:25,009
and I want to bring it into Lists

16
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,000
for a more robust planning experience.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,008
You can follow along by downloading

18
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,001
the wedding plan checklist

19
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,008
from the exercise files.

20
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:37,002
Start by selecting new list.

21
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:41,005
Now I'll select from Excel.

22
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:43,008
Select upload file and navigate

23
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,006
to the Excel document on your computer.

24
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,008
Then the wizard brings me

25
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,009
to the customized screen

26
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,006
where I'm instructed to select the table

27
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:54,003
from the file.

28
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,005
I'll check the column types,

29
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,005
and choose a new type

30
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,004
if the current selection is incorrect.

31
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:02,006
I will leave task as the title of the item.

32
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:03,005
For the when column,

33
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:05,006
I have a few categories, nine to 12 months

34
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:06,009
six to nine months.

35
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:11,000
So I'll select choice in the dropdown.

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,002
Then select next.

37
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:16,006
I'll set the name to checklist for wedding,

38
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,003
and I want to add a description.

39
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'll enter wedding plan checklist

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,001
for 12 months to one week out.

41
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,006
I'll select the clipboard icon,

42
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:33,000
and select create.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,009
Just like that,

44
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,001
the Excel data is imported into my new list.

45
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,000
Looks good.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,004
But one thing isn't quite right.

47
00:01:40,004 --> 00:01:42,007
The when choice column is not color coded

48
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:45,002
like choice columns usually are.

49
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,003
Select the dropdown next to when,

50
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:52,006
and select column settings then edit.

51
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:55,005
The edit column panel appears on the right.

52
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,006
I see that my choices were not imported

53
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,009
so I will add them manually

54
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:01,001
by selecting add choice.

55
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,005
My first time span is nine to 12 months.

56
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:07,007
So I'll enter that in the choice one box.

57
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,001
I will select the palette icon,

58
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,001
and set this as green.

59
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,001
I will repeat this for six to nine months,

60
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,002
four to six months and two to four months.

61
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:24,003
Choosing a new color each time.

62
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,001
I can save the choices I entered,

63
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:31,002
and the when column is updated.

64
00:02:31,002 --> 00:02:33,000
By taking advantage of Lists ability

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,005
to import directly from an existing

66
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,007
Excel spreadsheet.

67
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:37,001
You have the power to transform,

68
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,001
and simplify a lot of data.

69
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,008
Now it's your turn.

70
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:42,008
Find an existing list you have in Excel,

71
00:02:42,008 --> 00:02:45,000
and import it into Microsoft Lists.
