00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,005
- [Instructor] Once your data is in a list,

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,005
it's time to optimize it to be organized and efficient.

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,007
In this lesson,

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,004
I'll show you how to use List functions that save time

5
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:11,004
and help you stay organized when managing projects.

6
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,001
I'll start from office.com.

7
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,009
Select the app launcher in the upper left corner

8
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:17,005
and open Lists.

9
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:21,008
To get started, I'll go to the checklist for wedding.

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:24,005
Let's start by adding dates to the List items.

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:27,001
To create a date column, I'll select add column

12
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,007
to the right of the last column

13
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:31,009
and select date and time.

14
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:33,009
I'll enter due date for the title

15
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:36,001
and this truly needs to be accomplished by

16
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,000
for the description.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,008
Select save and the due date column is added.

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,002
I can also switch to edit and grid view

19
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:48,008
for another way to view data in Lists.

20
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:50,007
The edit grid view window is similar

21
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,002
to editing data in a spreadsheet.

22
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:56,001
I like using this view when I have a lot of data to enter

23
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,000
at one time.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,005
To get started, I'll select edit and grid view

25
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:02,003
in the top left of the window.

26
00:01:02,003 --> 00:01:06,004
From here, I can easily add multiple due dates.

27
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:08,006
When I select one of the due date cells,

28
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,001
Lists will display a calendar

29
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,005
so I can easily select the correct date.

30
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,008
I'll pick Friday for the first task

31
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:16,002
and select the following Friday

32
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:25,006
for the next two tasks.

33
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:31,003
To save my changes, on the top select exit grid view.

34
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:34,007
Next, let's look at creating other list views.

35
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:38,004
On the top ribbon, select the all items drop down

36
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:42,005
then choose create new view.

37
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to create a calendar view

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,006
so I'll select calendar.

39
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,004
Let's name this view checklist due dates.

40
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,009
I want to create a calendar view

41
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,007
so I'll select calendar.

42
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:59,001
Lists automatically populates the start and end date fields.

43
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,002
I'll select create

44
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:03,003
and List switches to my new view.

45
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:05,004
Now you can view tasks by their due date

46
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:07,007
making it easy to see what's due when.

47
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,008
Now you know how to add dates and creative views

48
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:11,000
for your lists.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,006
Experiment with different list views

50
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,007
to see which works best for your project.
