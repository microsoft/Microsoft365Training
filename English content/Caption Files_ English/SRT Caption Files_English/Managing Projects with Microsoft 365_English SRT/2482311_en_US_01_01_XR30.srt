00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] How many lists do you use

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,001
to keep track of your life?

3
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:07,000
There's never a shortage of lists for work.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,009
Things I need to do today,

5
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:13,008
Potential future clients, emails I need to send, and more.

6
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,009
In this lesson,

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,003
I'm going to show you how to identify the benefits

8
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,003
of using Microsoft Lists

9
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,009
so that you can start thinking of ways to use it.

10
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,009
First off,

11
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:27,008
Microsoft Lists is a great tool for staying organized.

12
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,007
You can easily arrange your tasks

13
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:33,003
and to-do lists into a structured order.

14
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:35,000
I'll start from office.com.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,003
Select the app launcher in the upper left corner

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:41,002
and open Lists.

17
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:43,007
For example, I make Weekly ToDo lists

18
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:47,002
to keep track of all the different items I need to complete.

19
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,006
If I get assigned a new task this week,

20
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,005
I'll simply open my ToDo list,

21
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:58,001
select add a new item, and then add the title.

22
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,009
Another benefit of Microsoft Lists, is availability.

23
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,001
You could access your list from your desktop,

24
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,005
your phone, on the web, and even from Teams.

25
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:10,008
And finally, Microsoft Lists seamlessly integrates

26
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:13,004
with Microsoft 365 apps.

27
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:16,001
Because Microsoft Lists runs in the Cloud,

28
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,007
you can feed data to other apps

29
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:20,001
without uploading or downloading.

30
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,001
From my ToDo list,

31
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:23,003
I'll select integrate in the top menu

32
00:01:23,003 --> 00:01:25,008
and see all the Microsoft 365 apps

33
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:27,007
I can feed data into.

34
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:28,009
With Power Apps,

35
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:31,003
you can create an app using your list data.

36
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,009
Power Automate, allows you to automate your routine

37
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,001
using your list.

38
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,007
And Power BI, will let you create a visualization

39
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,004
using your list data.

40
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:42,008
Organization, availability, and seamless integration

41
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:45,000
Make Microsoft Lists a powerful tool

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,003
to keep you organized and moving forward.

43
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:49,005
So the next time you move to write down a list,

44
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,001
I encourage you to give Microsoft Lists a try.
