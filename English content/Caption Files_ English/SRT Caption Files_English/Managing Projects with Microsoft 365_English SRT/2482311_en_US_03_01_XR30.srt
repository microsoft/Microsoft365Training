00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] When you're managing a project,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
you'll be tracking lots

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,008
of moving parts and tasks.

4
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:08,002
Microsoft Project has powerful work management capabilities

5
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:10,009
that can be used by both project managers

6
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,006
and team members alike.

7
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:14,007
In this lesson, I'll show you

8
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,002
Microsoft Project's key features.

9
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:19,006
The first feature I want to highlight in Project

10
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,006
is task dependencies.

11
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:23,003
A project is often made up of tasks

12
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,000
that depend on each other.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,002
I'll start by opening the August wedding project

14
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:28,001
I've been working on

15
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,006
so you can see how Project lists the various pieces

16
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:33,003
that need to come together for the event.

17
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:36,004
For example, the determined budget task is dependent

18
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:39,000
on the discussion with the couple about wedding size,

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,001
location and scope.

20
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,002
Grid view is fine for listing out the tasks,

21
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:46,008
but with dependencies,

22
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,005
it's much easier to understand

23
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:57,004
the information using a timeline.

24
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:58,008
This view gives me the timeline

25
00:00:58,008 --> 00:01:01,005
of when tasks are due and their dependencies.

26
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:02,008
Once dependencies are created,

27
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:05,003
I can see the critical path.

28
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,008
The critical path shows the specific tasks,

29
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:11,000
that if delayed, will delay the entire project.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,004
By analyzing a critical path,

31
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:16,008
you can also identify how to shorten the project length.

32
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,001
To view the critical path,

33
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,001
on the top menu,

34
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:25,008
select Filters and toggle Show Critical Path on.

35
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:28,003
All the tasks highlighted in red need

36
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,009
to be completed on time to meet the deadline.

37
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,005
Microsoft Project will help you manage large timelines

38
00:01:34,005 --> 00:01:35,009
and projects.

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,007
If you need to identify dependencies

40
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:40,007
or the critical path, check out Microsoft Project.
