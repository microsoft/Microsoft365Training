00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,004
- [Instructor] Microsoft Project

2
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,006
can help you get the most

3
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:04,005
out of your projects.

4
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,006
Here are a few tips that I like to use

5
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:10,002
when building detailed and comprehensive projects.

6
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:13,004
In this lesson, I'll use an example client wedding project

7
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:15,003
to show you how to change dates,

8
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:19,006
attach files, and add custom columns.

9
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:21,008
Every project has a start date,

10
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:25,000
but like most things in life, things change.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Microsoft Project lets you change the start date

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,006
and then the tasks will adjust accordingly.

13
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,004
I'll start from Office.com,

14
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:35,001
select the app launcher in the top left corner,

15
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,005
and open Project.

16
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,000
Note that using Project for the web

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,006
requires an active subscription to Microsoft Project.

18
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:47,004
I'll start by opening the client wedding project.

19
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:52,008
Next I'll select the Timeline view.

20
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:55,008
Here, the project tasks start in April,

21
00:00:55,008 --> 00:00:59,007
but recently the client decided to push the date by a month.

22
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:02,005
I can adjust the schedule by changing the start date

23
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:06,003
by selecting more actions, Project Details,

24
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,009
and then the Calendar in the Start field.

25
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:16,005
Close this with the X to save.

26
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:19,000
If I change the start date to one month later

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,001
all the other tasks also shift by a month.

28
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,003
By attaching files related to your tasks

29
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,009
in Microsoft Project,

30
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:27,009
you can keep your project assets organized

31
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:30,008
and shared with your team.

32
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,006
I'll go to the Board view by selecting Board at the top

33
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:37,002
and select Finalize budget.

34
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,007
I have a template that I would like Lynne to use,

35
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:41,008
so I will add it to the task.

36
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:44,003
To the right of the task, in Attachments,

37
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,007
I can select Add Attachment.

38
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:49,000
There are three choices.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,002
From computer, from teams files, and from URL.

40
00:01:53,002 --> 00:01:55,003
Since my document is on my computer,

41
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:57,008
I'll select from computer.

42
00:01:57,008 --> 00:01:59,006
Navigate to the file.

43
00:01:59,006 --> 00:02:02,001
Then select Open.

44
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,001
When I close the task properties,

45
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,006
I can see the attachment on the task card.

46
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:10,001
I can upload all files relevant to this client

47
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,004
and access them from the tasks.

48
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:15,009
You can also add custom columns to tasks.

49
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,005
Say I want each task to be reviewed.

50
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:22,001
I'll start by selecting Grid in the top bar.

51
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:24,001
I want to add a column named Reviewed,

52
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:25,008
with a Yes/No dropdown,

53
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:30,003
so my team can specify if the task was reviewed or not.

54
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:34,003
I'll select Add column and select New field.

55
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,008
I'll select Yes/No for the type,

56
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:44,002
and name it Reviewed and select Create.

57
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:47,000
My custom column Reviewed has been added

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,003
with No as a default value.

59
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,002
Once a task has been reviewed,

60
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,004
I can select the dropdown

61
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:57,002
in the reviewed column and choose Yes.

62
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,008
Now, you know a few pro tips

63
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:00,008
that can enhance your work.

64
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:03,000
Try using attachments and custom columns

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,008
to customize your next project.
