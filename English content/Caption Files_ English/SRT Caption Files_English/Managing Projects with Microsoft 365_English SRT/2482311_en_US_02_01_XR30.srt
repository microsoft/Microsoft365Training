1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Narrator] Think about the last event you attended.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,009
Was it virtual or in person?

3
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:07,003
You may have received information beforehand to prepare

4
00:00:07,003 --> 00:00:09,001
or a link to share photos of the event.

5
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,001
Now think of the preparation that had to happen

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,002
before the event.

7
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,007
The key to a great event is good planning,

8
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,006
and Microsoft Planner can help.

9
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:19,008
In this lesson, I'll show you some of the critical benefits

10
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:21,004
of using Microsoft Planner

11
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:24,008
and ways to utilize it for anything you need to plan next.

12
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,006
In this example, I'll show you how I used Planner

13
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,000
to organize a wedding.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,007
I created buckets for each phase the team completes

15
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,009
to put the wedding together by the deadline.

16
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:35,009
Planner also keeps due dates clear.

17
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,008
Knowing when individual tasks are due,

18
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:40,001
helps me see the big picture of the timeline.

19
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,000
With Planner, you can enter the dates for the tasks

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,009
to be completed.

21
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,001
Here you can see, I have many tasks,

22
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,008
including some that have due dates.

23
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,001
Planner is also a great collaboration tool

24
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:52,009
that makes it easy to assign tasks to your team members.

25
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,009
Depending on the size of your project,

26
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,002
you may have many people working with you.

27
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:59,005
Each member of your team can be assigned tasks

28
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:00,009
that speak to their skills.

29
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,004
Here you can see I'm collaborating

30
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:04,004
with team members for this wedding.

31
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,004
We work together to complete tasks

32
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:08,005
and can see the progress of the event.

33
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:11,005
Schedule view lets us see if we're ahead or behind schedule

34
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,006
and if our team members need help completing a task.

35
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:16,004
Next time you go to organize an event

36
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,004
or track the progress of your business,

37
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:20,002
use Planner to stay organized.
