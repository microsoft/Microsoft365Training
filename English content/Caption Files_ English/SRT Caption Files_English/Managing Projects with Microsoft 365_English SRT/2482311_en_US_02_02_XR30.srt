00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] As a project manager,

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:04,007
I'm coordinating multiple projects throughout my day.

3
00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:06,006
I need a way to manage my work

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,006
to achieve maximum productivity.

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:11,005
Becoming comfortable in Planner helps me stay on top

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:14,002
of my projects on a day-to-day basis.

7
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:17,000
In this lesson, I'm going to show you the easiest way

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,004
to access the most important parts of Microsoft Planner

9
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,006
so you can start managing your plans.

10
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:25,004
I'll start from office.com and select the app launcher

11
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,009
in the top left corner.

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:30,005
Then open Planner.

13
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:33,000
This opens Planner hub where you'll find all the plans

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,004
you have access to.

15
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,009
The navigation menu on the left is where I look to create

16
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:39,007
a new plan and find tasks assigned to me.

17
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,005
I've pinned the June wedding plan and below it is a list

18
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:44,005
of recent plans I've been working on.

19
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,001
The recent section shows the plans

20
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,007
I've opened most recently.

21
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:51,000
To find all your plans, select all.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,003
Finally in the left menu, select assigned to me

23
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:56,004
to see a list of all the tasks that are assigned

24
00:00:56,004 --> 00:00:57,008
to your account.

25
00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,000
By default, my tasks are grouped by progress with buckets

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,004
for not started, in progress, and completed.

27
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:07,005
Tasks with a date highlighted in red are overdue,

28
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:09,004
making them easy to identify.

29
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:12,002
I can also use the group by dropdown in the top right

30
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:15,006
to sort my tasks by priority.

31
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:19,008
This way I can see which ones I should focus on first.

32
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,005
Consider an upcoming event you need to plan.

33
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,004
I encourage you to open the Planner app

34
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,009
and explore the features to optimize the efficiency

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,000
of your next event.
