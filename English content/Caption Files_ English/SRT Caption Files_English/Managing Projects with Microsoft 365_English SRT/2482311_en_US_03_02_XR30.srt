- [Instructor] Microsoft Project

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,003
has a wide variety of helpful tools.

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,005
In order to get the most out of these tools,

4
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,008
you need to know what they are

5
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,005
and where to find them.

6
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,004
In this lesson, I'll show you how to locate key features

7
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:13,004
within Microsoft Project.

8
00:00:13,004 --> 00:00:16,006
I'll start from Office.com, select the App Launcher

9
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:19,003
in the top left corner, and open Project.

10
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,007
Note that using Projects of the web

11
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:22,001
requires an active subscription

12
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:23,009
to Microsoft Project.

13
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,000
The Project homepage is where you'll find all

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,009
the Microsoft Projects you have access to.

15
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,001
At the top, there's a new blank Project button.

16
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,009
I can also see two main sections

17
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,003
on the homepage: Favorites and Recent.

18
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:40,003
Favorites has all the projects I've tagged as important.

19
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:43,001
I'm currently working on the August Wedding project.

20
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,008
I can mark this project as a favorite

21
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:49,006
by hovering over the project and selecting Mark Favorite.

22
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,006
As I complete projects,

23
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:54,005
I can un-favorite them by selecting More Options

24
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:57,007
and choosing Remove From Favorites.

25
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,001
The Recent panel contains the projects

26
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,005
you've opened most recently.

27
00:01:01,005 --> 00:01:02,004
When I need to look back

28
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:06,002
on previous projects, Recent helps me find them quickly.

29
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:07,003
As you work with Projects,

30
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:10,002
team members may share their projects with you.

31
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:11,002
You can see shared projects

32
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:14,001
by selecting the Shared With Me tab.

33
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,003
Finally, if you want to narrow your search

34
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:18,004
to see just the projects you've created,

35
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:21,009
filter by selecting the Created By Me tab.

36
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:26,003
Now only the projects I've created are displayed.

37
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,004
I encourage you to explore the Project interface

38
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,000
before creating your first project.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,003
You'll be comfortable

40
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:34,007
with this Project management tool in no time.
