00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:03,004
- [Instructor] I love when I can quickly create lists.

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:05,000
With Microsoft Lists,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,006
I'm able to consistently stay on top of what I need to do.

4
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,009
In this lesson,

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,005
I'm going to show you the simplest way

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:14,009
to access the most important parts of Microsoft Lists.

7
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,009
I'll start from Office.com,

8
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:20,004
select the App Launcher and Lists.

9
00:00:20,004 --> 00:00:22,003
Here, you can see the Lists homepage

10
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,009
with Favorites displayed first.

11
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,005
My Favorites contains the lists I've tagged as important.

12
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:31,005
Here, you see my Conference Plan list.

13
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,007
To add a Favorite, select the star icon

14
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,001
when hovering over any list.

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,000
I will hover over Spring wedding show

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,007
and select favorite this list

17
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,005
because that event is coming up soon.

18
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:45,001
As I complete projects or finish lists,

19
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:49,007
I can remove this list from Favorites by selecting the star.

20
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,009
When you need to look back on previous projects,

21
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,008
Recent lists can help you find them quickly.

22
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,006
To see all the lists you've created,

23
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,001
use the dropdown to the right of Recent lists

24
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,001
and select My lists.

25
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,009
I can now see all the lists I've created in a single page.

26
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:09,001
Harness the power of Microsoft Lists

27
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,003
by signing in and beginning to navigate

28
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:13,002
all the features in the app.

29
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,003
You'll be amazed by the improvements you'll make

30
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:16,008
in your project organization.
