00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,002
- [Instructor] Communication is key

2
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:03,001
to the success of any team.

3
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:06,004
Using text-based messages to communicate is efficient,

4
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,008
fast and keeps everyone in the loop.

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,005
In this lesson, I'll show you how to post messages

6
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,003
in all your Team's channels

7
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:15,009
to keep your teammates connected.

8
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,005
For this example, I've already opened Teams

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:21,009
and created a team to collaborate on an upcoming conference

10
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,000
that we're all working on together.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,007
I want to communicate to everyone on my Microsoft Team

12
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:30,004
by welcoming them and sharing how excited I am

13
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,007
to work on this event.

14
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:35,004
To do this, I select my announcements channel.

15
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:40,004
Starting from the post tab, I'll select new conversation

16
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:42,004
and I can begin my announcement.

17
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,008
I want to make sure I get my team's attention.

18
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:47,001
You can use mentions to send a notification

19
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,008
to an individual, a channel or a team.

20
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:53,007
I'll mention the entire team by entering @Skills conference

21
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,006
and selecting the team.

22
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:59,009
Now I can type in my message.

23
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,001
And now I can click send.

24
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,001
By mentioning the Skills conference team,

25
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,008
I've ensured that everybody in the Skills conference team

26
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:15,001
received a notification that I've posted this message.

27
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:19,002
In addition to sending a notification to an entire group,

28
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:22,003
I can also get the intention of an individual.

29
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:25,000
When posting in a channel, everyone can see

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,009
and respond to the post.

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,001
If there's a message that should be private,

32
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,002
sending a direct message or chat is best.

33
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:36,000
I want to ask Joni to share the draft planning document

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,004
with the team in the planning channel.

35
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:40,003
I'll navigate to the planning channel

36
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,005
and select the posts tab.

37
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:46,005
I'll start a new conversation

38
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,006
and I'll use the @ symbol and type in Joni's name

39
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:52,005
to mention her in my post.

40
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:55,004
Using mention ensures that Joni gets a notification

41
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,007
that I've posted.

42
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,000
Now that you know how to communicate with messages

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,003
in a channel and how to draw attention

44
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,005
to your messages using mentions,

45
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:05,000
practice these techniques

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,006
to streamline your communication with your team.
