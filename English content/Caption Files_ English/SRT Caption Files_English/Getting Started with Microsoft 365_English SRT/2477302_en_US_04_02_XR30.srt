00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,003
- [Instructor] Time is precious.

2
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:03,006
When your team is frequently using a document,

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:05,001
you can save everyone time

4
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:07,004
by adding that document to a tab.

5
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:08,002
In this lesson,

6
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:11,004
I'm going to show you how to add tabs to your channels

7
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:15,006
to help your team get to their most needed content swiftly.

8
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:16,007
For this example,

9
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,001
I've already opened Teams

10
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,007
and created a team to collaborate on an upcoming conference.

11
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,008
I'm working on a skills conference with my team.

12
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:26,004
I've already created a team with specific channels,

13
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:28,005
but I want to make it even easier for my team

14
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:30,007
to collaborate and complete their work.

15
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,002
My logistics team is constantly using

16
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,004
and adjusting the rooms

17
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:36,009
that will be used for the skills conference.

18
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,004
Everyone is collaborating in the same file and that's great.

19
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:43,009
The file is in the files tab for my logistics channel,

20
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,009
but I want to make it even easier for them

21
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,003
to access this frequently used file.

22
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:51,003
So I'm going to add this file as a tab

23
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:52,006
in the logistics channel,

24
00:00:52,006 --> 00:00:55,002
so it can be accessed with one step.

25
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:59,002
First, I need to go to my logistics channel.

26
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:02,001
Then, I'll go to the files tab

27
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,008
and select "show actions" next to the file name.

28
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:08,001
A window will pop up

29
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,006
giving me several actions I can take with this file.

30
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,008
I can open it, copy it, rename it, and more.

31
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:18,000
But for right now, I just want to make this file a tab,

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,005
and so I'll select "make this a tab".

33
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:24,007
The file is now a tab in my logistics channel

34
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:28,003
making it easy to access by everyone in the channel.

35
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:31,005
You can add a variety of tabs in your channels.

36
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:33,003
To see all the available options

37
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:35,005
for adding tabs in your channels,

38
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:38,001
select the "add a tab" button.

39
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,006
You can add websites, files from different apps,

40
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:44,009
like Word, OneNote, Excel, and PowerPoint.

41
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,009
There's so much to explore.

42
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,004
Adding tabs to your channels is easy.

43
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,009
Try it out to make it easier for your team

44
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:54,006
to access the items they need quickly.
