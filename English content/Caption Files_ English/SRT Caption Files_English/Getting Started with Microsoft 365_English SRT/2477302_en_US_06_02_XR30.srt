00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,007
- [Instructor] When your whole team is using SharePoint

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:05,000
the level of engagement is incredible,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,008
to further increase your team's engagement

4
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,008
it's important that you know how to use some

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,003
of the more advanced features of SharePoint.

6
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:16,004
And this listen, I'm going to show you how to use sections

7
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:19,003
and web parts to add more features

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:22,001
within your SharePoint site.

9
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,004
To get started, I'll open SharePoint.

10
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:27,007
I've already created a communication site

11
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:29,008
and named it skills conference page

12
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:32,001
for an upcoming conference.

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,003
Now I want to change the layout

14
00:00:34,003 --> 00:00:37,004
and look of the site and add some content.

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:41,002
I want to start by changing the layout on this page.

16
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:44,001
The layout of a SharePoint page is made up

17
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:46,002
of different sections.

18
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:50,000
Sections are distinct areas on the page

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,008
and each component in a section is called a web part.

20
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:56,006
Before I can make any changes, I need to go

21
00:00:56,006 --> 00:01:00,006
to the top right corner and select edit,

22
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:04,006
on the left bar I can edit my sections.

23
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:09,006
I simply click the plus and options open up,

24
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:15,000
I can add, edit, move, duplicate,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,001
or delete a section from here.

26
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:21,003
I want to remove one of my sections,

27
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,009
so I'll scroll down to the section

28
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,005
I'd like to remove, select it,

29
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:30,006
and in the options on the far left, select delete.

30
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,004
I can see the section has been deleted.

31
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:36,000
Now I want to edit the web part

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,006
in the section at the top of this page,

33
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:43,005
this web part is a hero which allows you to display

34
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:47,007
up to five items using text, images, and links.

35
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,008
To edit this web part

36
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:53,008
I'll select it and select edit web part,

37
00:01:53,008 --> 00:01:58,008
I can display my hero web part as tiles or layers.

38
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:02,008
Selecting tiles displays my hero with images and links,

39
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:05,009
selecting layers displays my hero with images,

40
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,005
text, and links.

41
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:10,002
I want to display text and images,

42
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:14,004
so I'll keep layers selected from my layout options.

43
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:17,003
One of the features that makes SharePoint so useful

44
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:21,003
is you can easily edit when you need to add more content.

45
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,009
Currently, my site has three layers.

46
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,009
A layer contains an image, text, and a link.

47
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:31,004
I only have a small amount of content that I want to share,

48
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,006
so I only need one layer.

49
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:37,007
So under layout, I will choose the one layer layout.

50
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:39,009
Now that I've got the right layout,

51
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,003
I can start to edit the image,

52
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:45,000
text, and link for my web part.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,004
To edit the individual components of a web part,

54
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:52,002
I need to go to edit web part details.

55
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:54,002
I need to select the web part

56
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:57,002
and find the edit details button,

57
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,008
once selected an edit menu pops up with the edit options,

58
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:04,000
right now I don't need to link anything,

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so I want to remove the link.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,001
I just need to go down to the options menu and expand it,

61
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,004
for this web part the link is actually

62
00:03:12,004 --> 00:03:14,005
a part of a call to action,

63
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,000
so to remove the link

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,005
I'll just select no for show call to action link.

65
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:24,004
When I'm ready to add a link I can move show call to action

66
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,008
to yes, and add my link and call to action

67
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:29,006
text when I'm ready.

68
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:32,004
I want to change the text for this web part,

69
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,003
so I'll edit the title and description

70
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:38,005
to be specific to the skills conference.

71
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:42,001
I see that my new title and description have been added,

72
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,009
now I want to change the image that's displayed

73
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:46,005
on this web part.

74
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:51,003
I'll expand the background image section and select change.

75
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:53,002
I don't have images of my own to use,

76
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:56,006
so I'll select stock images.

77
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:58,002
I'll search for conference

78
00:03:58,002 --> 00:04:03,005
in the search bar and select a photo I like,

79
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:09,001
once I've selected the image, I'll see the image on my page.

80
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,007
Under the image in the background section

81
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:15,000
I will add alternative texts to make my site accessible

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,005
for those who can't see it,

83
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:20,001
the changes I've made look great.

84
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:24,001
I want to add one more thing to my page before I finish,

85
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,007
a countdown timer to get the team excited

86
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:29,003
about the upcoming skills conference.

87
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,008
I'll close this web part for now.

88
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:34,000
Before I add the countdown timer,

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,005
I want to clean up my page a bit.

90
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to select showcase a variety of images

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,007
and remove that web part.

92
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:45,002
Now I want to add a new web part

93
00:04:45,002 --> 00:04:48,002
and I'll add a countdown timer.

94
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:51,000
You can change the title and description directly

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,002
from this web part by selecting them,

96
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,003
I'll change the title to skills conference

97
00:04:57,003 --> 00:05:01,003
and change the description to countdown to fun.

98
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:04,009
You can also change the date and time for your countdown

99
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:08,006
or even add a call to action link or a background image,

100
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,005
lots of options to customize

101
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,007
the look of this countdown timer.

102
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:17,005
Looks great to me, so I'll close my editing window.

103
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:20,006
I like this look, it's a great landing page

104
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,008
and I know I can come back

105
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:25,000
and easily add or edit more content.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,001
I'll select republish to make sure that

107
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,005
when I share my site,

108
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:31,004
everyone else can see the updated version.

109
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:33,007
Now you can make engaging sites

110
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,007
using sections and web parts.

111
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,006
Give it a try.
