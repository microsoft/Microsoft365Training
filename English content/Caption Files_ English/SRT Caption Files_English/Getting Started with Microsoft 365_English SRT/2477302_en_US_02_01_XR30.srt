- [Instructor] Like on a television,

2
00:00:01,003 --> 00:00:03,004
radio, or even walkie-talkie,

3
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,005
different channels have their own unique purpose

4
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,006
and their own unique conversations.

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:13,000
In Teams, channels are used to help organize files,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,007
communications, and people around different topics

7
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:18,006
to keep team members connected

8
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:21,008
to what they need to maximize their workflow.

9
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,009
In this lesson, I'll show you how to add

10
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,001
and remove channels for your team

11
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,001
so that you can make sure the right people are connecting

12
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:32,001
and collaborating in the right places.

13
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:33,008
I'll start in the team I've created

14
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:36,001
for an upcoming skills conference.

15
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,002
I've already created a team, added members,

16
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,008
and given members appropriate access.

17
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,008
Now want to begin organizing the places

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,002
where we will collaborate and communicate.

19
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:48,006
Currently, the logistics channel is open

20
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,001
to everyone on the team and anyone that is a part

21
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,002
of the skills conference team will have access

22
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:55,003
to all files and chats.

23
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:58,000
I would prefer to make logistics private for only

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,009
the team members that are working on logistics directly.

25
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:04,008
But after a channel is created, you can't make it private.

26
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:06,005
Now I need to delete this channel

27
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,005
to recreate it as a private channel.

28
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,007
I'll delete it

29
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,006
by selecting the More Options button beside the name

30
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:17,007
of the channel, and selecting Delete This Channel.

31
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:20,009
It's important to remember that when you delete a channel,

32
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,004
you delete everything in the channel.

33
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,003
So make sure when you're ready to delete,

34
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,004
you're ready to delete everything.

35
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,004
To recreate this same channel

36
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,008
as a private channel,

37
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:36,003
I'll go back to the team's name and select More Options.

38
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:38,009
Then select Add Channel.

39
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,004
It prompts me to enter a name.

40
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:45,001
I will name this channel Logistics Internal.

41
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,002
Now I can adjust this channel's privacy.

42
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:51,003
I only want to share this with selected team members,

43
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:56,007
so I'll choose Private, and then select Create.

44
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,001
Now that I've created a private channel,

45
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:03,007
I'm able to add only those select members that need access.

46
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,002
I'll add one of my teammates

47
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:08,005
to this channel by typing in their name,

48
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:11,009
selecting Add, and making sure

49
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,008
the team member has the appropriate access.

50
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:17,004
I click Done,

51
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:21,000
and my team member has been added to my channel.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,004
Now, when there's new activity happening,

53
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:25,002
like a new message,

54
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:29,002
only myself and other invited teammates will see it.

55
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:30,005
So, that's it.

56
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:32,000
You're now in control of access

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,003
to information in your teams.

58
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,009
Try adding channels to your team and test out

59
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:38,008
which end up getting used a lot

60
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,005
and which channels end up silent.
