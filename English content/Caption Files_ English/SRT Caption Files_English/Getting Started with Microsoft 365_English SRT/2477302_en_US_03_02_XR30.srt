00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] Sometimes you need your message to stand out.

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,008
A larger font, different colors, or maybe something more,

3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:08,001
all these make your message clearer.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,009
In this lesson, I'll show you how to edit

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,001
the formatting of your Team's post to highlight your message

6
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,007
and make key items more apparent.

7
00:00:16,007 --> 00:00:19,006
Since I am responsible for planning a skills conference

8
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:20,008
with a team of people,

9
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:23,004
it will be a great example to show.

10
00:00:23,004 --> 00:00:24,003
For this example,

11
00:00:24,003 --> 00:00:27,008
I've already opened Teams and created a team to collaborate

12
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:29,002
on an upcoming conference

13
00:00:29,002 --> 00:00:31,005
that we're all working on together.

14
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:32,009
I've created a team

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,001
to streamline our work and communication,

16
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,009
but I also want to share some upcoming tasks

17
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:39,006
that need to be completed.

18
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to use some additional formatting features

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,003
to add to my post.

20
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:47,007
So I'll go to Announcements and select new conversation.

21
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:49,003
Then select format.

22
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,009
From here, I'll change and edit the announcement

23
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,003
before I post it.

24
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,001
I'll use a heading in bullets

25
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:57,006
to share the action items for the week.

26
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,009
The Mention feature is used to get the attention

27
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:03,002
of people or groups for specific action items.

28
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:05,002
Since I want the marketing and PR group

29
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:06,005
to have a draft flyer,

30
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,009
I'll mention this group in the first item in my list.

31
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,001
I want Joni to set up a call for the team.

32
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:16,007
I can mention her and ask her to set up a call.

33
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:19,004
I'll make this the second item on my list.

34
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:22,009
I need everyone on the team to submit weekly updates,

35
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,003
so I need to make that task stand out.

36
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,000
So I'll go to the formatting ribbon,

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,004
select bold, then select change font color, and choose blue.

38
00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,008
Now, I'll type in a task for everyone.

39
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:42,004
Now, my text really stands out.

40
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,004
My post looks good.

41
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,006
To send it to the team,

42
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:49,001
I'll select Send and off it goes.

43
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,006
Formatting a post is a really simple way

44
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:55,000
to make what you have to say really stand out.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,004
Now you can make your messages do more for you.
