00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,001
- [Instructor] In the workplace,

2
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,007
you don't always have the time

3
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:05,003
or a quiet space to take a phone call,

4
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:07,007
so chatting can be a lot more practical.

5
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,000
Using the chat feature

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,004
in Teams allows you to have a flexible conversation

7
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:12,008
when you want to reach out

8
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,000
to people in your organization quickly.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,009
In this lesson,

10
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:18,005
I will show you how to use Teams to easily

11
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,003
and quickly communicate.

12
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:22,003
In this example, I'll show you what to do

13
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,001
if I wanted to reach out to a teammate

14
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,002
just to check in on the status of a meeting,

15
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:30,003
let's go.

16
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:33,009
Once I'm in Teams, I'll select Chat to get started.

17
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:37,000
I have quick access to my recent chats here,

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,006
but if you want to start a new chat

19
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:41,006
or can't find the chat you need in your recent chats,

20
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,006
you can select the New Chat button.

21
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:45,002
As a chat window opens,

22
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,001
you can enter who you want to send the chat

23
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:49,004
to, either a specific individual

24
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:52,000
or a group, simply type in the name or email

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,005
of the person you want to chat with and select their name

26
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:58,003
or email to add them to the chat.

27
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:01,003
From here, you can also add more people.

28
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:04,005
If you want to remove anyone from the message,

29
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,008
you can select the X next to their name.

30
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,009
At this point, I can begin typing in my message.

31
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,001
Isaiah is working with me on an upcoming skills conference.

32
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to know if Isaiah is planning to come

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,007
to the planning meeting next week.

34
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'll just send him a message to ask.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,005
I'll type in my message.

36
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,009
Then select Send.

37
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,004
I've now sent my message,

38
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:31,003
and I can continue working and wait for Isaiah to respond.

39
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:36,002
Once Isaiah responds, I get a notification,

40
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:41,002
and I can also find the activity in chat.

41
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,001
Now that you know how to communicate with chats and teams,

42
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,003
you can feel confident

43
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:47,009
in reaching out to anyone in your organization.
