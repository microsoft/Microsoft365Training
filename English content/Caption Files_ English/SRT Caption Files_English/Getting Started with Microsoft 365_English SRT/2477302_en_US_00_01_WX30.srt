00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Narrator] The best workplaces are filled with

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,002
collaboration, teamwork and shared activities.

3
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:07,002
Positive results come from a team

4
00:00:07,002 --> 00:00:10,003
where everyone works towards a shared goal.

5
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:13,005
Each member knows their role and responsibilities,

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:14,007
and clear communication

7
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:17,008
makes collaborating something to look forward to.

8
00:00:17,008 --> 00:00:21,003
But how do you facilitate that with a modern team?

9
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:25,001
With Microsoft 365, of course.

10
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,003
I'm Courtney Hodge, a Program Manager at Microsoft,

11
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,006
and I'm passionate about helping people use technology

12
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:33,006
to make their lives easier.

13
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:34,004
In this course,

14
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:37,005
I'll give you the tools to maximize Microsoft Teams

15
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:40,006
to support your communication and collaboration.

16
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,004
I'll teach you how to use SharePoint

17
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:45,002
to work with your team and create engaging sites

18
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:48,007
to get people excited about events or programs.

19
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,001
I'll show you how to integrate these tools

20
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:55,004
into your team's workflow and how to gain new efficiency

21
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,007
in everything you do at work.

22
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,006
I don't know about you,

23
00:00:58,006 --> 00:01:02,005
but group projects were never my favorite in school.

24
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:05,009
But learning to utilize Microsoft Teams and SharePoint

25
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:09,002
makes working with your team easy and efficient.

26
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,003
So if you're ready

27
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,002
to take your teamwork to the next level,

28
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:14,000
let's jump right in.
