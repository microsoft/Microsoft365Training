00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,006
- [Instructor] Sharing information

2
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,006
is key to business success.

3
00:00:03,006 --> 00:00:05,007
Your team members may come to your site

4
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:09,000
to learn or to help build the next idea.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,009
how to share your SharePoint site

7
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:14,005
with stakeholders.

8
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:17,003
In this example, I'm responsible for organizing

9
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,004
a skills conference for my team.

10
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:21,006
I have a team site for presenters

11
00:00:21,006 --> 00:00:24,000
working on the conference to collaborate.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,009
I also have a communication site

13
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:28,002
to share information about the skills conference

14
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,002
with everyone at my company.

15
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:32,001
I want to share the team site,

16
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,007
and communication site with the right people.

17
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:36,009
From the start page,

18
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,005
I want to go to my skills conference presenters

19
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,008
team site.

20
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,002
I'll select members,

21
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,004
and the details of my group membership

22
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,000
appear in a window.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,003
From here I can change permissions,

24
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,007
and add new members to this site.

25
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,008
I can also remove members,

26
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:56,008
and owners from this group.

27
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:59,004
Now I'll show you how to change permissions

28
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,003
on a communication site.

29
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:05,004
I'll navigate to the skills conference page.

30
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,006
To manage permissions,

31
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:10,001
I'll select share from the upper-right corner.

32
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm the only owner,

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,009
and there are no members and no visitors

34
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:17,001
on this site.

35
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,003
Owners have full control of the site.

36
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:21,009
Members can view and edit,

37
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,006
and visitors can only view the site.

38
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:25,004
From this window,

39
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,009
I can also add users or groups

40
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:29,005
to share this site.

41
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,001
I want to share the site

42
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,000
with everyone except external users.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,002
So I'll type in everyone,

44
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:40,008
and select everyone except external users.

45
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:43,005
Now I'll select share,

46
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:45,009
and I'll check the permissions again.

47
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:49,004
When sharing with everyone except external users,

48
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:53,001
by default, SharePoint only gives view access

49
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,006
or read permissions.

50
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:55,005
If needed,

51
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,001
I could change those permissions

52
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:01,002
by selecting the dropdown button under name.

53
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:03,005
I'll close share site now.

54
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:06,003
I have successfully shared my communication site,

55
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,006
and made sure people had the appropriate access.

56
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:12,001
Now you can share any site you create

57
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,009
with the appropriate people.

58
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:16,000
You can collaborate with a team

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,007
or create an engaging site

60
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:20,004
to get people excited about an upcoming event.
