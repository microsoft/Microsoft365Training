00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
- [Instructor] Keeping everyone on the same page

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,002
makes any team more efficient.

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:06,001
But when new members join,

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,000
valuable time can be wasted in bringing them up to speed.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,002
With Microsoft Teams,

6
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:15,002
modifying who's part of your team is simple and easy.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:18,003
In this lesson, I'll show you how to add team members

8
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:21,000
and manage their roles in Teams.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,003
To show you how, I've created a team

10
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,003
for a conference I'm working on.

11
00:00:25,003 --> 00:00:27,004
To bring everyone together to collaborate,

12
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:30,001
I need to make sure they are added to the team.

13
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,005
I'll start on the main Teams page.

14
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:36,000
To find the Skills conference team,

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,008
I'll use the menu to select teams from the sidebar.

16
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,006
Here you can see a list of all my teams.

17
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll navigate to the Skills conference team

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,009
and select More options.

19
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:51,002
Then select Add member.

20
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:53,009
Since I'll be adding new members that are already a part

21
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,005
of my organization, I'll be able to add them

22
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:59,000
by typing in their name or email address

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,007
and then selecting Add.

24
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,000
To add people outside of your organization

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,009
is a little different.

26
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,009
You still add them using their email address

27
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:12,000
but they will be added to the team as a guest.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,006
Guest roles cannot be changed.

29
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:18,008
When someone inside your organization is added to a team,

30
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:20,007
their initial role is member.

31
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:24,005
But you can change their role to owner, if you want.

32
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:27,001
Owners have the same permissions as members

33
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,004
but can also delete your team

34
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,004
and add or remove team members.

35
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:34,008
You can change a member's role to owner

36
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:39,001
by selecting the dropdown menu next to their assigned role.

37
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,001
In case the team needs editing when I'm away,

38
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,006
I'll add my colleague, Isaiah, as an owner.

39
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,000
Now that you can add team members to a team

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,005
and assign their roles,

41
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:52,001
you can start gathering the right people together

42
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,005
to collaborate on a project or event.
