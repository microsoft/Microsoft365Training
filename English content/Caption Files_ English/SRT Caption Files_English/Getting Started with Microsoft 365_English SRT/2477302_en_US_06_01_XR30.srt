00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,009
- [Instructor] SharePoint is the ultimate

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:03,003
file storage solution

3
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,001
to help you keep your digital resources organized

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,003
and accessible for you and your team.

5
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:10,005
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

6
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:13,007
how to create and manage file structures in SharePoint

7
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:18,001
so you can easily access and share files with your team.

8
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,003
I'll begin from my SharePoint start page.

9
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:24,006
I'm working on planning a conference with a team of people.

10
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:26,008
I want to create a place for my speakers

11
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:28,009
to submit their proposals.

12
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,004
I've created a team in Microsoft teams for this conference

13
00:00:32,004 --> 00:00:34,006
and named it Skills conference.

14
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:37,000
When you create a team in Microsoft Teams,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a site is automatically created for your colleagues

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,004
and SharePoint to store your group's data.

17
00:00:43,004 --> 00:00:47,001
I'll navigate to the skills conference team site now.

18
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,005
I'll select documents from the navigation pane

19
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:54,001
to access my document library for this site.

20
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,005
After selecting documents, I can see there are folders

21
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,007
for the different channels

22
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:02,004
within the Skills conference team I created.

23
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:06,003
I want to create a place for speakers to submit proposals.

24
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,002
So, I'll select the content folder

25
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,002
and make a sub-folder in there.

26
00:01:12,002 --> 00:01:16,000
To create a sub-folder, I'll select add new,

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,006
then choose folder and I'll name it session proposals.

28
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,007
Then, select create.

29
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,008
To add a file to the folder,

30
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll select the session proposal folder I just created.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,007
Then I'll select add new and choose word document.

32
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,005
This takes me to Word where I can write up

33
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:41,006
my proposal for a session.

34
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:43,005
I want to propose leading a session

35
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:47,004
on creating a SharePoint site so I'll rename my document,

36
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:50,009
how to create a SharePoint site.

37
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,004
I'll add a brief description of my session

38
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,001
so others know what it's about.

39
00:01:56,001 --> 00:02:00,000
Next, I'll make sure my document is saved.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,008
When I return to my site,

41
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:05,001
I can see my file in the folder I created.

42
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,007
I can also upload files to SharePoint

43
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:10,002
like a finalized speaker flyer.

44
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:13,002
First, I need to navigate to documents.

45
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:17,001
I want to store this file in my Marketing and PR folder

46
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:19,005
so I'll select that folder.

47
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,008
Since this is a speaker flyer,

48
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,005
I'll put it in the presenter marketing.

49
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:27,004
Then, I'll select upload.

50
00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:31,004
Since I'm uploading a file, I'll choose files.

51
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:35,006
Next, I'll select the file I want to upload.

52
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,009
This file is now in the document library

53
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,007
of my SharePoint site,

54
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:42,006
but I can also find this document in Teams.

55
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:46,001
If you select more actions for a file,

56
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:49,003
a menu opens and you can select several different actions

57
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,009
you can use in a document library.

58
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,007
You can explore these on your own

59
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,006
but I'm going to show you version history.

60
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:59,004
Selecting version history allows you to see

61
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,006
when a file was modified and who modified the file.

62
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,001
If you hover over the timestamp for your file

63
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:08,008
and select the dropdown button, you can view,

64
00:03:08,008 --> 00:03:13,000
restore or delete a version of your file.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,009
Now that you know how to create

66
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,001
and upload files in SharePoint,

67
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,007
you're ready to start collaborating with your team.
