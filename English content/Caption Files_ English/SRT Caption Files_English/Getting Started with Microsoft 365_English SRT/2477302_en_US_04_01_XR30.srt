00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,001
- [Instructor] An important part of collaboration

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:04,002
is gathering input from team members

3
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:06,000
about the work you're creating.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,002
Team's channels make it easy to share your work.

5
00:00:09,002 --> 00:00:11,007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to pass files

6
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,006
back and forth with your teammates

7
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:16,002
in your Microsoft Team's channels.

8
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:19,000
In this example, I'm working on a skills conference,

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,007
and I have a team and channels set up.

10
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:24,009
There are two ways to add a file to a team's channel.

11
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:26,009
You can share a file in the posts

12
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:30,004
or you can add a file to the File tab in the channel.

13
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:34,002
Let's dive in to see this in action.

14
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,009
For this example, I've already opened Teams

15
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,006
and created a team to collaborate on an upcoming conference.

16
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,009
I'll first show you how to share a file

17
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:45,000
in a post in a channel.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,004
I want to share a list of the rooms we have for the conference

19
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:51,003
and the number of people that can fit in each room.

20
00:00:51,003 --> 00:00:54,003
In the Logistics channel, I will create a post

21
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:58,009
and then select attach to attach my file to the post.

22
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:03,001
I will select attach from the menu in the conversation

23
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:06,003
and navigate to the file I want to attach.

24
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:11,003
Once I select the file, I'll choose Upload a copy.

25
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:14,002
The file is now attached to my message.

26
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:16,003
I can now select send

27
00:01:16,003 --> 00:01:19,007
and post the file to the Logistics channel.

28
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:22,005
Once the file is posted, I can find the file

29
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:26,002
in the Files tab in the Logistics channel.

30
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:29,006
In addition to sharing files in a post in a channel,

31
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,006
I can also upload files directly to the Files tab.

32
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,008
Adding files directly to the Files tab

33
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:38,000
allows you to manage the files' structure

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,002
or where the files are placed.

35
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:43,004
I want to share a flyer in the Marketing channel,

36
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:48,005
so I'll start there and select the Files tab.

37
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,001
The flyer I'm uploading is a draft flyer

38
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:51,005
for presenters at the conference.

39
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:56,000
So I want to select the Presenter marketing folder to open it.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,008
I already have this document,

41
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,008
so I'll choose Upload from the menu.

42
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:07,005
I'll select Files, and I'll select my DRAFT Speaker Flyer.

43
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,009
Open it.

44
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,009
My document is now in this folder.

45
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,002
Now that you can share files with your team

46
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,005
through posts and in the Files tab,

47
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,003
you'll be collaborating with your team in no time.
