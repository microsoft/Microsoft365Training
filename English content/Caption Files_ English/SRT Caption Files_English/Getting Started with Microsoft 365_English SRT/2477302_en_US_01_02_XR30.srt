00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,003
- [Instructor] Building a team takes time.

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,007
You need to transfer or recruit the right members,

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:08,004
build relationships and trust each other.

4
00:00:08,004 --> 00:00:09,006
On the other hand,

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,007
creating a team in Microsoft Teams

6
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:13,008
takes hardly any time at all.

7
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:14,006
In this lesson,

8
00:00:14,006 --> 00:00:17,001
I'll use an upcoming event I'm working on,

9
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,006
the skills conference,

10
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,009
to show you how to set up a team,

11
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:24,001
using templates to save even more time.

12
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,005
Let's jump in.

13
00:00:25,005 --> 00:00:27,002
Once I'm in Teams,

14
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:30,008
I'll select teams from the left menu.

15
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:36,004
Then select join or create a team from the bottom.

16
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,002
If you were joining a team

17
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,002
that someone else had created,

18
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:43,009
you might be given a code to join a specific team

19
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,007
and you'd select join a team.

20
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,001
Since this conference

21
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,007
doesn't have a team set up already,

22
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:53,008
as the manager, I'll need to create one.

23
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:57,007
So I'll select create team.

24
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,002
I can either create a team from scratch

25
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:01,009
or from a template.

26
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:04,006
I see a manage an event template

27
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,006
which will work great for this.

28
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:10,002
I'll select that option to get started.

29
00:01:10,002 --> 00:01:12,005
Here, Teams will display an overview

30
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,008
of the channels and apps associated with that template.

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,006
Just select next to continue.

32
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:20,007
Next up is the privacy level.

33
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:23,002
Because I don't want anyone to access my team

34
00:01:23,002 --> 00:01:24,009
without me inviting them,

35
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,006
I'll make it private.

36
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:27,007
For naming the team,

37
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,005
I want to be brief, but descriptive.

38
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,005
Since I'm planning a conference,

39
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:35,004
I'll name it skills conference.

40
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:36,009
I'll also include a description

41
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:38,007
to give the members a way to know

42
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:40,008
what the team is about.

43
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:42,003
Like all templates,

44
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:44,008
this one comes with pre-made channels.

45
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,009
Think of a channel

46
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:48,008
as a place to talk about a specific topic.

47
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:49,009
When I manage events,

48
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,003
I need to create channels

49
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:54,003
where the whole team can discuss broad topics

50
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:56,005
and other channels where smaller groups

51
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:59,001
can talk about specific subjects.

52
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:02,003
If I expand customize channels,

53
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:05,000
I can see all the channels for this team.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,003
The general channel is automatically created

55
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:11,004
with every team and cannot be deleted.

56
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:14,007
Most of these other channels are useful here,

57
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:16,004
but my team won't be a part of

58
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:19,002
any budget related conversations,

59
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,005
so I'll rename that one technology

60
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,003
since our conference will be hybrid this year.

61
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:28,005
I can rename the channel by selecting budget,

62
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,008
and replacing the channel name.

63
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:33,005
I can save my change

64
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:37,004
by clicking on customize channels.

65
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:39,006
At this point, everything is set up

66
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,000
and I'll select create team.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,004
Now, it does take a little while

68
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:46,005
for a team to get set up

69
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,003
so just be patient

70
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:50,008
and come back a little bit later.

71
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:52,000
As you can see,

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,005
it doesn't take much effort

73
00:02:53,005 --> 00:02:55,002
to create a team.

74
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,009
When you're able to create a team,

75
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,000
you're in a position to start streamlining communication

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,008
and collaboration for your next event or project.
