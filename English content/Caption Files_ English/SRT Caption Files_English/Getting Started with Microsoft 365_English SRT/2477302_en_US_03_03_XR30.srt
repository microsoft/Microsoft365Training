00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:06,000
all this file management is key to your workflow,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,005
but what's the best way to keep your shared files

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:11,003
inside Microsoft Teams organized?

5
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,007
Folders.

6
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:13,007
In this lesson,

7
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:15,002
I'll show you how to enhance

8
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,004
your team's organization and workflow

9
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:21,002
by creating new files and folders in Teams.

10
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:23,009
For this example, I've already opened Teams,

11
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:26,001
and created a team to collaborate on

12
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,006
in an upcoming conference.

13
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,001
I'm working on a skills conference with my team.

14
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,008
I've created a draft flyer

15
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,008
for the presenters of the conference,

16
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:37,002
but I don't yet have a draft flyer for attendees.

17
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,007
So I first want to set up folders

18
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,001
to keep my flyers organized.

19
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,001
A flyer is a marketing tool.

20
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:48,006
So I'll first go to the marketing and PR channel.

21
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,005
Next, I'll select the files tab.

22
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,001
Now I can set up the folders for the files

23
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:55,004
to go into.

24
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,007
I need folders to separate the marketing

25
00:00:57,007 --> 00:01:00,001
for attendees and presenters.

26
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,005
So I will create those new folders

27
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:06,006
by selecting ad new and choosing folder.

28
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:09,009
I'll name my folder, attendee marketing,

29
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,001
and select create.

30
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,008
I've now created a folder

31
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:15,001
in the marketing channel

32
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:17,008
for attendee marketing files.

33
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll do the same for presenter marketing

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
by once again selecting ad new,

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,006
choosing folder,

36
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:29,001
and I'll name this folder presenter marketing,

37
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:32,001
and select create.

38
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:33,005
While in the files tab,

39
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,002
I want to go into the attendees marketing folder,

40
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:38,004
and click the folder.

41
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:41,003
This takes me to the content of this folder.

42
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:42,004
It's empty right now

43
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,009
since I just created the folder.

44
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,001
Now, from inside this folder,

45
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:49,005
I can create the new file.

46
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:51,006
I'll select new,

47
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:55,005
and then select PowerPoint presentation.

48
00:01:55,005 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll name this presentation

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,005
draft attendee flyer.

50
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:02,001
Once I select create,

51
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:06,002
it takes me to my new PowerPoint presentation.

52
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,005
I use PowerPoint for flyers

53
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:11,000
just to use the designer features.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,003
I can use the navigation pane on the left side

55
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:14,008
to get back to the files tab

56
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,005
for my marketing channel.

57
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:19,000
And if I go to the attending marketing folder,

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can see my presentation.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,001
Now you can create and organized files in Teams.
