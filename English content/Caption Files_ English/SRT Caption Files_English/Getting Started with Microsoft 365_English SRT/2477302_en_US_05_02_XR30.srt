00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:01,008
- [Instructor] There will be times

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,005
when you'll want to share news,

3
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,003
a status update on a project

4
00:00:05,003 --> 00:00:06,007
or maybe you want a page

5
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,007
where people can learn more about an event

6
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,009
or program.

7
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create

8
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:14,001
a SharePoint communication site,

9
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:16,000
and show you how to use these sites

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,003
with your team.

11
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:19,004
From my SharePoint start page,

12
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,006
I'll select create site.

13
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,002
I want to share information,

14
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:25,006
and engage other viewers.

15
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,009
So I'm going to choose to make this

16
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:30,004
a communication site.

17
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:37,004
I'll name the site skills conference page.

18
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:40,007
For right now, I'll leave the description blank

19
00:00:40,007 --> 00:00:42,001
because I'll come back later,

20
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,001
and describe the site's purpose.

21
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:50,003
After I've named my site, I'll select finish.

22
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,000
After I select finish,

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,004
I land on my new communication site,

24
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:57,007
and from here I can edit content.

25
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:59,005
I want to get everyone excited

26
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,004
about the upcoming skills conference.

27
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:03,002
So I'm going to use this site

28
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:04,002
to share information

29
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:07,005
to build anticipation for the event.

30
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:11,007
The site has one page so far, the homepage.

31
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,005
I like the look of this homepage,

32
00:01:13,005 --> 00:01:15,003
but I want to see if templates

33
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:17,005
will offer me other options.

34
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,000
So I'll go to the upper right-corner,

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,005
and select settings.

36
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:26,008
I have several options to choose from here.

37
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:30,002
The first thing I want to do is apply a site template

38
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:33,003
to help change the overall layout of my site.

39
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:35,002
So I'll select that.

40
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:37,004
Once the select a template window opens,

41
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:41,003
you have several templates to choose from.

42
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:45,000
If you hover over a template and select details,

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you'll get a clearer picture of the site layout,

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,009
and what the site is used for.

45
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,004
I want to see more details

46
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:54,003
on the showcase template,

47
00:01:54,003 --> 00:01:58,004
so I'll select details.

48
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:01,001
I like the look of the showcase layout.

49
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:08,007
So I'll select use template.

50
00:02:08,007 --> 00:02:10,008
I've created a communication site

51
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,003
using a template.

52
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,001
I'll need to add content to this site

53
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,002
before I'm ready to share it with others,

54
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,005
but I'm off to a super start.

55
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,008
Now you know how to add a communication site

56
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:21,008
in SharePoint.

57
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,008
Soon you'll be ready to add content,

58
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,006
and share your site with others.
