00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,005
- [Instructor] The best teams,

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,005
the groups that stand out above the rest,

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:07,006
work incredibly well together.

4
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:10,001
Each individual team member

5
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,006
understands the end goal, stays focused

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:17,006
and willingly and enthusiastically collaborates.

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:22,008
Microsoft's chat-based workspace Teams is the perfect place

8
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:25,008
to make that engagement and collaboration happen

9
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:27,002
in your workplace.

10
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:31,004
In this lesson, I'll show you why Teams is such a great tool

11
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:33,005
to make the most of your team.

12
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:35,002
Let's dive in.

13
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:38,001
In the top left corner of office.com,

14
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:41,006
select the app launcher and open Teams.

15
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:44,004
Before discussing specific features in Teams,

16
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,005
I want to explain the layout.

17
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,004
The Teams homepage has a menu to the left

18
00:00:49,004 --> 00:00:51,004
and a search bar at the top.

19
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:55,002
Select Activity to see your feed.

20
00:00:55,002 --> 00:00:58,002
This is where you'll find mentions, replies

21
00:00:58,002 --> 00:01:00,001
and other notifications.

22
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:03,009
If you select filter and more options

23
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,005
you can search for a specific type of activity,

24
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:10,003
like mentions, replies or reactions.

25
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,000
Chat is one of the main ways you can quickly communicate

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,008
with people or groups.

27
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:19,004
Select Chat to see the different conversations you're having

28
00:01:19,004 --> 00:01:21,007
with groups or individuals.

29
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:26,002
You can filter in Chat to show unread chats,

30
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,006
meetings, or muted chats.

31
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:32,000
Selecting Teams allows you to see all the Teams

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,002
you are a member or owner of.

33
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:39,001
Teams is the ultimate filter when it comes to workflow.

34
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:43,007
A Team can house your communication and files in one place

35
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:46,002
so you can compartmentalize your work

36
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:49,001
into specific projects or groups.

37
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:52,007
You can call an individual or jump on a conference call

38
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:55,003
with voice and or video.

39
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:59,004
If you select Calls, you can see your call history

40
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:01,002
and your contacts.

41
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:04,007
Select Contacts, and you can see a list

42
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,007
of all your contacts.

43
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:11,009
You can also add contacts here using the add contact button.

44
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,001
The search bar can save you valuable time

45
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,000
searching for content in Teams.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,004
You can search for contacts, messages,

47
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,008
files and more all in one place.

48
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:23,006
With an integration with Outlook, you have access

49
00:02:23,006 --> 00:02:25,008
to your calendar in the place you work.

50
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,002
As you're working and collaborating with teammates

51
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:29,008
you may want to know when you're free

52
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:32,007
for a follow-up chat or to work on a task.

53
00:02:32,007 --> 00:02:36,003
Select Calendar to find your scheduled meetings.

54
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:40,009
And, finally, you've got access to OneDrive right here.

55
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:44,004
Need to quickly access a file you're collaborating on?

56
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:48,001
Selecting Files will allow you to access files

57
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,007
in Teams and OneDrive.

58
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,003
Now that you understand the value and the layout of Teams,

59
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:56,001
you're ready to get into action.
