00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,004
- [Instructor] SharePoint can do many things:

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:06,003
run websites, store files, host resources,

3
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:08,000
all from your browser.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,005
In this lesson, I'll show you SharePoint's key features

5
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,008
so that you can use it with confidence.

6
00:00:13,008 --> 00:00:17,006
To get started, I'll open SharePoint using a web browser.

7
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,000
Organizations use Microsoft SharePoint

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,008
for a number of reasons.

9
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:24,006
SharePoint is an app that you connect to through

10
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:27,006
your web browser for a variety of purposes.

11
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:30,001
Not only can you use it to create websites,

12
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,007
you can also use it as a secure place to store, organize,

13
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:36,007
share, and access information from any device.

14
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:39,003
I want to use SharePoint to share presenter files

15
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:41,004
and resources for a skills conference

16
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm planning with my team.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
To get started, in the top left corner of office.com,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,002
select the app launcher and open SharePoint.

19
00:00:50,002 --> 00:00:53,007
I am now at my SharePoint start page.

20
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:58,003
In the top left corner of the SharePoint start page,

21
00:00:58,003 --> 00:01:02,005
you'll see options to create sites or create a news post

22
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:04,005
if you want to make an announcement.

23
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:07,003
On the navigation bar on the left,

24
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:11,004
you can easily access your SharePoint start page,

25
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:15,001
the sites you're a member of, new news posts

26
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:19,001
from your sites, and your SharePoint files.

27
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:23,001
In the middle of the page is the News from sites section.

28
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:25,001
This is where you'll find news from the sites

29
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,006
that you're a member of.

30
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,004
If you see an article you'd like to view later,

31
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:31,002
simply add it to your reading list

32
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:34,006
by selecting the bookmark icon on the article.

33
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:37,002
Once bookmarked, the article is added

34
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,002
to your Saved for later section

35
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:41,003
found in the pane on the left.

36
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:43,008
Directly under News sites is a section

37
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:47,005
that displays your most frequently used SharePoint sites

38
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:51,001
and the recent activity on each of those sites.

39
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,006
You can favor a site here by selecting the star

40
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:56,003
in the upper right corner.

41
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,007
This will add the site to your Following list.

42
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:01,009
Now that you know your way around SharePoint,

43
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,009
you're ready to use your SharePoint start page today.
