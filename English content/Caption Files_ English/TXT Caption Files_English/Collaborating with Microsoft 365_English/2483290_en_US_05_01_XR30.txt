 - [Joni] When you need to present  
 important ideas visually, PowerPoint is the tool  
 that takes your communication to another level.  
 In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through  
 how to create a presentation in PowerPoint and add  
 your first slide.  
 First I'll open PowerPoint.  
 And in this example, I've been selected  
 for a remote job interview and was asked to  
 create a PowerPoint presentation to showcase my skills.  
 So next, I'll select New blank presentation.  
 Before going too far I want to make sure  
 I've renamed and saved my presentation.  
 I can see the save status next to the title  
 of the presentation, and it is saved.  
 If I select the title, a new window opens,  
 and I can rename the presentation Interview slides.  
 After I renamed the presentation,  
 I can select anywhere outside the window and it will close.  
 I want to focus on adding content at the moment.  
 And so I'm going to close Designer.  
 The first slide is a title slide.  
 So I'll write the title, Skills overview.  
 Then I'll add my name under the title  
 so my audience will remember me.  
 I now have the first slide in my presentation and I'm ready  
 to add more slides.  
 Now, you know how to create a PowerPoint presentation.  
 Go ahead and try to add a slide to your own presentation.
