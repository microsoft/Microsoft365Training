 - [Joni] Scrolling through an endless inbox  
 for that one email you need can feel like  
 trying to find a needle in a haystack,  
 but Outlook has a search tool that makes it easy  
 to find any email.  
 In this lesson I'm going to show you how to search  
 your email inbox.  
 I'll start in my Outlook inbox.  
 In this example, I have an interview for a job,  
 and the company has asked me to create a PowerPoint  
 presentation for my interview.  
 The company sent me an email with the presentation  
 instructions but I can't remember all of the requirements.  
 To be able to know exactly what's expected of me,  
 I'll need to search for this email in Outlook.  
 I remember the email had the word presentation in it.  
 So I'll go to the search box and type in  
 the word presentation then select Enter.  
 This searches my email for all the emails  
 with the word presentation.  
 Here's the email I was looking for.  
 I'll open it to see the requirements.  
 As you can see Outlook has also highlighted the search word.  
 If you wanted to narrow your search to only find emails  
 that have attachments, you could use Filter.  
 First, I'll navigate back to my Inbox.  
 I'll select the Filter button above my mailbox,  
 select Attachments, and now my mailbox is only showing  
 emails that have attachments  
 Now that you know how to search your email,  
 you'll be able to quickly find any email  
 even if it's buried deep in your inbox.
