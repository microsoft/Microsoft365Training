 - [Joni] Have you ever witnessed a presentation  
 that was so text-heavy,  
 you didn't know where to focus your attention?  
 Not a fun experience.  
 Formatting texts into different fonts and colors  
 can help your audience clearly understand  
 your presentation's message.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you how you can use PowerPoint  
 to change the appearance of your presentation's text  
 so that your audience can keep their focus  
 on the most important information.  
 In this example,  
 I'm creating for an upcoming job interview.  
 You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation  
 from the Exercise Files.  
 Now that I have my presentation open,  
 I want to change the font color,  
 so I'll select change font color from the menu,  
 then choose the color I want  
 and watch my highlighted text change to that color.  
 Next, I want to italicize the text.  
 With the text highlighted,  
 I'll select italics from the menu.  
 Looks great.  
 Now you can alter the look of any text you add  
 to a PowerPoint to help your presentation stand out.
