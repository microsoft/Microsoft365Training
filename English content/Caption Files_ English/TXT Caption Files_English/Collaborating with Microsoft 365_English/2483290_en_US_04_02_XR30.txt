 - [Instructor] Sometimes an email can say it all,  
 but for those times  
 when you need to say a bit more,  
 attaching a file can help you add  
 even more important information.  
 In this lesson,  
 I'm going to show you how to use Outlook  
 to send attachments  
 so that you can easily include  
 relevant files with your email  
 To show you how to use attachments,  
 I'm going to use the example  
 of trying to look for a new job.  
 I heard of a new opportunity,  
 and I'll need to attach my resume  
 to an email to share it.  
 First, I'll open Outlook.  
 From my Outlook inbox,  
 I'll open the email that I need to reply to.  
 I'll select reply,  
 and then I'll select add attachment.  
 A menu opens to help me find  
 the file I'm looking for.  
 Since I saved my document to Microsoft's  
 file hosting service OneDrive,  
 I'll select browse cloud locations.  
 I'll navigate to the file I'll need.  
 Select it and select next.  
 Now I can choose if I want to share a link  
 to my file or a copy of it.  
 If I was working on editing the file  
 with someone else,  
 I would share a link,  
 that way we could work on the file together,  
 and see updates in real time.  
 Since I'm sharing my resume  
 with a potential employer,  
 and we don't need to collaborate on the document,  
 I will choose attached as copy.  
 My resume is now attached to my email.  
 I'm ready to send it.  
 So I select send and my email and attachment  
 are on their way.  
 Try adding an attachment to your next email.
