 - [Instructor] Have you ever finished  
 describing the steps of a complex task  
 only to realize it would've been simpler  
 to arrange the steps in another order?  
 In this lesson,  
 I'll show you how to apply slide layouts  
 and change the slide order  
 so your PowerPoint presents and flows perfectly.  
 In this example, I open PowerPoint  
 to start adding to the presentation I'm creating  
 for an upcoming job interview.  
 You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation  
 from the exercise files.  
 I already have two slides created,  
 and I want to add a new slide  
 that shares some information about myself.  
 I'll choose a title and content slide  
 to show this information.  
 I'll title it About Me.  
 Then, I'll add a few highlights to introduce myself  
 and my background.  
 I love helping people.  
 I've recently completed a customer service training.  
 Now that I see the slide,  
 I think I'd like to change the layout  
 to leave room to add a picture later.  
 I can select Layout to see my options.  
 I'll change the current layout to Two Content.  
 Hmm, this slide order doesn't seem right.  
 I think I want the About Me slide  
 to go in front of my skills slide  
 so my audience gets to know me before my skills.  
 To change the slide order,  
 I'll select View  
 and make sure I'm in the Normal view setting.  
 In the Normal view setting,  
 I can see the image of my slides  
 on the slide and the navigation pane.  
 I can go to the navigation pane  
 and select the About Me slide,  
 then drag and drop it above my skills slide.  
 My slides are now in an order that makes sense.  
 So that's it.  
 Now, you can change the slide layout and the slide order.  
 Use this skill to reframe how you share information  
 in any of your PowerPoint presentations.
