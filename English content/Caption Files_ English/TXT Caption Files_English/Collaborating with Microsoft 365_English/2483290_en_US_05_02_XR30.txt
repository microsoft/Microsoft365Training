 - [Instructor] Keeping a consistent composition  
 throughout a PowerPoint presentation  
 allows your audience to focus  
 on the important ideas you're presenting  
 without getting distracted.  
 In this lesson I'm going to show you  
 how Designer can help you  
 create a consistent look throughout your presentation  
 keeping your audience's attention  
 on your PowerPoint's content,  
 not its composition.  
 So first I'll open my presentation in PowerPoint.  
 You can follow along by downloading  
 the sample presentation  
 from the exercise files.  
 In this example,  
 I've already created a presentation  
 that I've been asked to prepare  
 for an upcoming interview.  
 Now, I want to change the look  
 of the presentation by using Designer  
 to get started.  
 Now that I'm in my presentation,  
 I'll select Designer.  
 Wow.  
 Look at all of these different looks.  
 I'll find a design I like  
 and choose it.  
 Now that I've chosen a design,  
 I can add a new slide.  
 I'll select the dropdown  
 beside the New Slide icon,  
 then I can choose the layout  
 of the slide I want to add.  
 I'll add a Two Content slide,  
 giving me a layout with space  
 for the title and two types of information.  
 I'm going to add a new title  
 and name this slide, Software skills,  
 then add text in one of the content sections.  
 By using Designer,  
 my entire presentation will have a consistent look  
 that will keep my audience's attention  
 on my skills.  
 I encourage you to explore design ideas  
 and choose a look for your presentations  
 that will wow your audience.
