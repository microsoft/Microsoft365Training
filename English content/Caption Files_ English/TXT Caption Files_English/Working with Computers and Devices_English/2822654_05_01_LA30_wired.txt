 - Let's take a look at how to connect your computer  
 to your network via a wired Ethernet connection.  
 Now, this assumes that your network has already been set up  
 in your home, office, or classroom.  
 If you're connecting to your home network,  
 you're most likely going to run an Ethernet cable  
 from your computer directly into your router.  
 If you're connecting in an office or classroom environment,  
 chances are you'll be running an Ethernet cable  
 from your computer into an Ethernet port on the wall  
 or some other fixture,  
 which in turn connects to your network.  
 In any case, the important thing is  
 that you have a cable running from whatever the source  
 of your network connection is  
 into the Ethernet port on your computer.  
 Nearly all desktop computers have built-in Ethernet ports,  
 though you're not seeing them as much on laptops these days,  
 as in the past.  
 If your laptop doesn't have Ethernet  
 or if you're using a tablet or a mobile phone,  
 you'll connect wirelessly to your network,  
 which we'll look at how to do later.  
 This case, though, I'll just plug the cable  
 that's running from my desktop's Ethernet port  
 right into my router.  
 And once you have your computer connected  
 to your network via Ethernet,  
 chances are you're already on your network  
 and you're so-called setup is done.  
 In most cases, once you connect your computer  
 to your network with an Ethernet cable,  
 you'll automatically be connected to the network and be able  
 to communicate with other computers on the network,  
 as well as access the internet.
