 - [Narrator] An important part of making sure your computer  
 and its programs continue to run smoothly  
 is to periodically check for and install updates  
 to your operating system.  
 For example, both Microsoft and Apple  
 frequently release updates to their Windows  
 and Mac OS operating systems,  
 often fixing bugs and adding new features.  
 To check for updates in Windows 10,  
 go to the start menu,  
 to settings, and select update and security.  
 Make sure Windows update is selected  
 and then click check for updates.  
 As long as you're connected to the internet,  
 Windows will check for system and security-related updates.  
 If any updates are available,  
 you'll see the progress of them being downloaded  
 and you'll have the option to install them,  
 which often involves restarting your computer.  
 So it's a good idea to make sure you're not working  
 in other applications or on any projects  
 when you're checking for and installing updates.  
 You can see I currently see this message  
 saying that I'm up to date,  
 meaning there are no system or security updates available,  
 but notice there is a feature update available  
 to my version of Windows 10.  
 And if I'm ready to install that,  
 I can click download and install now to begin that process.  
 And you can see now we'll go through the process  
 of updating Windows.  
 But again, if you don't see any available updates,  
 it means your computer is already up to date.  
 But you can still check back here periodically  
 to see if any updates have been released.  
 Again, it's a good idea to install updates  
 to make sure your computer continues to run smoothly.
