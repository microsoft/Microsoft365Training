 - [Instructor] If you're working in a word document  
 that contains a lot of text and you need  
 to replace a word or sentence,  
 you can use the built-in Find and Replace feature.  
 This can be useful, for example,  
 if you realize you've been spelling someone's name wrong  
 throughout the entire document,  
 or some new information has changed some data  
 in your document that you now need to update.  
 Under the Home tab here in Word,  
 you'll locate the editing section.  
 And this is where you'll find the Find and Replace buttons.  
 So for example, I've noticed in this document  
 about the history of the Landon Hotel  
 that the founder Arthur Landon's name is misspelled  
 in a couple of different places.  
 You can see here the name is spelled with an A  
 instead of an O.  
 It would be time consuming  
 to read through the entire document  
 to locate each instance of this mistake.  
 So instead, I'm going to click the replace button.  
 In the Find What field, I'll type the word  
 that I'm looking for, which is the incorrect spelling  
 of Landon and in the Replace field,  
 I'll type the correct spelling of the name.  
 At this point,  
 you have a few options on how to find or replace this text.  
 If you click Find Next,  
 the first instance where it finds of the spelling  
 will be highlighted.  
 If I want to fix this instance, I click Replace.  
 I move this out of the way.  
 You can see that's now been fixed.  
 Word then jumps to the next instance.  
 But since I know that I want to correct all the instances  
 of this misspelling, I can click Replace All,  
 and Word will automatically change every instance  
 in the document.  
 And I get this notification telling me  
 that it made three replacements.  
 I'll click Okay.  
 And I'll Close.  
 So that's the find and replace feature in Word.  
 And again, it can be a big time saver,  
 especially in longer documents containing a lot of text.
