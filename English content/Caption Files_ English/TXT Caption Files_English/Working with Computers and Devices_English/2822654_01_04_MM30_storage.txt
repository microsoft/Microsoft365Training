 - Another common device you'll most likely use  
 at some point or another  
 is an external hard drive or storage device.  
 An external drive can be a simple flash or thumb drive  
 like this one.  
 These typically plug into your computer's USB port,  
 and you can get them in a variety of capacities  
 depending on how much storage space you need.  
 But for significantly more storage space,  
 you'll have to go with an external hard drive like this one.  
 These can also connect to your computer via USB.  
 You'll do need to be aware of the type of USB connector  
 that the drive uses though.  
 Many drives still use the older standard USB connector  
 while newer drives use what's known as USB-C.  
 You'll have to make sure that drives connector  
 is compatible with the USB ports on your computer.  
 If they're not compatible, you'll need an adapter  
 or a different drive.  
 Larger external drives often require  
 that you plug them into their own power outlet as well.  
 Although you will find some models  
 that are powered through the USB port.  
 But using an external hard drive or a thumb drive  
 is simply a matter of plugging it into your computer.  
 After a moment, you should see an alert appear  
 to determine what to do with the external drive.  
 I'll click that alert.  
 And basically windows is asking  
 what you want to do with this storage device as detected.  
 To view the contents of the drive,  
 choose Open folder to view files.  
 And now we're seeing the contents of the drive I plugged  
 into my PC.  
 Now, if the AutoPlay window didn't show up,  
 your preferences might have been changed.  
 To check your preferences, go to the Start menu,  
 Settings, select Devices,  
 and select AutoPlay.  
 And here makes sure Use AutoPlay for all media and devices  
 is switched on.
