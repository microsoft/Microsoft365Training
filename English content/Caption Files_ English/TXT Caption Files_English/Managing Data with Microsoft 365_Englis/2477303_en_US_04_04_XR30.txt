 - [Instructor] Imagine you're staring at a table  
 in Excel and attempting to make sense  
 of the relationships between several sheets.  
 Working with data  
 it appears in.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you  
 how to use Power BI's intelligent import tool  
 to assist you in creating relationships  
 between several sources of data.  
 You'll be able to join data  
 to make it easier to work with.  
 You can install Power BI on your PC  
 by going to the Microsoft Store,  
 and searching for Power BI.  
 When you open Power BI Desktop,  
 you'll see the start screen.  
 I'll go ahead and close it.  
 I'll open the report I've been working on.  
 You can download this in the exercise files.  
 It's called customer sample report.  
 This report has a list of names and addresses  
 of my customers.  
 I also have a separate Excel spreadsheet  
 with their orders.  
 I want to combine these to create  
 a visual aid for the delivery team.  
 First, select Excel Workbook  
 from the home tab on the top ribbon.  
 Then browse for the sales order workbook,  
 which has two sheets.  
 You can download this in the exercise files,  
 it's called sales order.  
 Select both sheets then select load.  
 After both spreadsheets load,  
 you can see the tables in the field's panel  
 on the right.  
 Select model on the left menu,  
 and you'll see the relationship  
 Power BI found between the different tables  
 when it loaded both sheets.  
 A data model is the relationship  
 between the different data sources.  
 On the top ribbon,  
 select managed relationships.  
 Here I can see that sales order ID  
 is the common field  
 between the sales order detail table,  
 and the sales order header table.  
 Additionally, customer ID is the common field  
 between the sales order header table,  
 and the customer table.  
 Now all three of the tables are connected.  
 Let's explore the customer ID relationship  
 by selecting the second row,  
 and then edit at the bottom.  
 The cardinality field tells Power BI  
 which table has the primary record  
 for the customer ID column.  
 In our example,  
 the customer table is the primary record.  
 So each customer ID will appear once.  
 A customer will likely place many orders,  
 and therefore Power BI  
 sets the cardinality to many to one.  
 You can modify this if necessary.  
 I'll select, okay.  
 Then close.  
 Pulling data from multiple spreadsheets  
 is a breeze in Power BI.  
 You can easily create relationships  
 between tables by finding the common fields  
 in those tables,  
 which means you can create reports  
 across multiple tables.  
 Take some time to build relationships  
 in Power BI with your existing spreadsheets.  
 You've got this.
