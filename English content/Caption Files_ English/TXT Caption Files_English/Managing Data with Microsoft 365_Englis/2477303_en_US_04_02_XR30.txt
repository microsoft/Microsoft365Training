 - [Instructor] Before you can start  
 creating cool visualizations,  
 you'll need to know the common functions,  
 and the screens used to import and review data.  
 In this lesson,  
 I'll show you how to navigate Power BI Desktop,  
 and connect the importance of reports  
 to the structure of the program.  
 You can install Power BI on your PC  
 by going to the Microsoft Store,  
 and searching for Power BI.  
 When you open Power BI Desktop,  
 you'll see the start screen.  
 Here you can see what's new,  
 the Power BI blog,  
 forums and various tutorials.  
 On the left, it's a menu of options  
 where you can get data, access recent sources  
 or open other reports.  
 Once you close the window,  
 you'll be in the workspace.  
 At the top,  
 you'll see the home ribbon.  
 This ribbon contains the most common  
 Power BI functions.

 to your workspace.  
 Excel workbook to import data into the program.  
 And transform data to merge data.  
 On the left is a bar with three buttons  
 for the report, data and model screens.  
 Power BI starts on the report screen.  
 This is where you'll create visualizations.  
 I'll show you a report I'm working on  
 for my sales team.  
 You can download this in the exercise files.  
 It's called sales team visualization.  
 In my workspace,  
 there are three visualizations.  
 When I select the data tab,  
 I can see the data used to create this report.  
 This is the customer table.  
 It looks similar to an Excel table,  
 and on the right is a list of the other data sets  
 imported into Power BI.  
 Next I'll select the model tab.  
 This gives you a graphical representation  
 of your data and its relationships.  
 In this example,  
 you're looking at customers, their orders,  
 the order details,  
 and the products they purchased.  
 Now I'll switch back to the report screen.  
 On the right side of the reports workspace,  
 you'll see three panels,  
 filters, visualizations and fields.  
 You can use filters to modify your visualizations  
 to only show a subset of data.  
 Power BI allows users to easily  
 switch visualization type  
 by simply selecting the visual styles  
 from the visualization panel.  
 There are typical bar charts, pie charts,  
 as well as advanced charts.  
 The fields panel is where you select the data  
 you want to report on.  
 When you import data sources into Power BI,  
 they will show up in the field panel.  
 You will this panel to select fields  
 for your visualizations.  
 Finally, the report workspace is broken down  
 into different pages.  
 You can add more by selecting  
 the plus at the bottom.  
 So that's a quick tour of Power BI.  
 Start small and import data  
 from an Excel workbook into the program,  
 and get comfortable with the tool.  
 Try it out.
