 - [Instructor] Data has become the foundation  
 in which everyone worldwide makes decisions.  
 But as helpful as data can be,  
 at times it can be overwhelming.  
 Microsoft Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool  
 that can create reports and dashboards,  
 allowing you to tell a story with your data.  
 In this lesson, I'll share the benefits of using Power BI  
 so that you can further your data visualization skillset.  
 Microsoft Power BI provides a visual framework  
 for sharing data.  
 Power BI can help model the information,  
 leading to beautiful, intuitive, interactive reports,  
 helping your audience gain insights.  
 Power BI Desktop is free to download to your PC  
 from the Microsoft store.  
 Power BI connects directly to your existing  
 Microsoft 365 documents, stored in your OneDrive  
 or SharePoint.  
 Being able to visualize your data  
 will give you an advantage as you communicate  
 with your team and clients.  
 I encourage you to download Power BI and give it a try.
