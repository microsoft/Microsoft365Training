 - [Instructor] Filters provide lots of benefits,  
 especially when working with data.  
 In this lesson,  
 I'll show you how to build PivotTables, select fields,  
 and use filters in your own data in Excel  
 to inform your business decisions.  
 In the top left corner of Office.com,  
 I'll select the app launcher and open Excel.  
 From here, I'll open the Test Sales Order spreadsheet.  
 You can follow along  
 with this document in your exercise files.  
 This spreadsheet has a dataset,  
 Sales Orders and their details.  
 Let's say that I need the data  
 by product and then by customer,  
 so that I can gain insight  
 into which products are doing well,  
 and which customers are purchasing them.  
 To do that, I'll create a PivotTable,  
 which will allow me to see the link  
 between the products and customers.  
 First, I'll select cell A1,  
 the first cell in my data set.  
 Then I'll select the Insert tab in the top ribbon,  
 and select PivotTable.  
 The PivotTable drop down appears,  
 and I will select From Table/Range  
 to get the data from this sheet.  
 The Insert PivotTable pane opens on the right.  
 In Source, I can see that Excel picked  
 the order detail sheet  
 and selected all the values in my table.  
 In the PivotTable pane,  
 I'll use Create your own PivotTable  
 and insert it on a new sheet.  
 This way, I am able to customize the PivotTable to my needs  
 and it will be separated from my current data.  
 This opens a new sheet  
 with the PivotTable on the left  
 and the PivotTable fields panel on the right.  
 In that panel, I can see there are two columns,  
 one for the headers from my data table,  
 and then one with Filter, Rows, Columns, and Values.  
 I'll choose the data points I need.  
 Products sorted by largest customer orders.  
 First I'll select Product  
 which populates column A with all the products sold.  
 Next, since I want to see  
 each customer that purchased those products,  
 I'll add Customer to the Filter section  
 and Line Total to the Sum Values section.  
 This aggregates all the line totals for each customer.  
 Let's filter this by Channel Outlet  
 to see what they purchased.  
 I'll select the dropdown  
 next to Customer in cell B2,  
 deselect Select All and select Channel Outlet.  
 I can also add Order Quantity to Rows  
 so that I can clearly see  
 the number of units this customer purchased.  
 Now it's your turn.  
 Take a look at your organization's spreadsheets  
 and create useful PivotTables in Excel.  
 You'll have your data in an easy to review format.  
 Try them this week.
