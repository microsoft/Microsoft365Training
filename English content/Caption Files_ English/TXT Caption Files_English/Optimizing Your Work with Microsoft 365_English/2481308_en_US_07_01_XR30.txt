 - [Instructor] And now we've reached the end of this course,  
 but it's not the end of your journey.  
 There will always be new things to learn  
 and new ways to build efficiency.  
 I want to leave you with some resources  
 that will help you along your way.  
 First, I recommend that you check out  
 the Microsoft Community page and join the conversation.  
 The Microsoft Community is a great place  
 to find quick tips and solutions  
 to typical issues that you encounter.  
 You can ask questions of the support team  
 as well as speak to other users just like you.  
 And lastly, explore the products and make mistakes.  
 It's only through making mistakes  
 that you can learn how to troubleshoot  
 and solve problems on your own.  
 I know that you have the ability and skill  
 to achieve anything you set your mind to.  
 Thanks for watching this course.  
 I wish you the best  
 as you learn new avenues for navigating your own success  
 and building the career that you want and deserve.  
 Good luck in all your future endeavors.
