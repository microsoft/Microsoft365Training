 - [Zakiya] In every changing world,  
 there are always new things to be learned.  
 As technology advances and new roles are in demand each day,  
 building on existing skills and learning new ones  
 is necessary to keep up.  
 You deserve all that comes with new opportunities  
 and you can do it.  
 My name is Zakiya Mackey and I've built my career  
 helping others build new skills, broaden their horizons,  
 and learn new tips for success.  
 In this course I'll cover some Microsoft 365 products  
 that will help in any tech based role.  
 I'll also help you use existing products  
 for maximum efficiency,  
 share best practices and industry standards,  
 as well as some pointers to optimize your workflow  
 in the workplace.  
 When you level up your workflow,  
 you can change your career trajectory  
 and become more successful.  
 I want you to be able to use Microsoft 365 tools  
 to stay organized, engage your audience,  
 and collaborate with others more effectively.  
 Let's get to it.
