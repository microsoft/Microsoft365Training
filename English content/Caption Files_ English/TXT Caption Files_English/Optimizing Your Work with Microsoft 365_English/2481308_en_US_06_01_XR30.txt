 - [Instructor] Have you ever had to send out  
 a mass communication, but wanted to customize  
 sections of the message for each recipient?  
 Mail merge allows you to send out individualized messages  
 to many recipients.  
 It can auto-fill names in the text  
 using a data source, like a list, spreadsheet, or database,  
 so recipients feel like it was addressed  
 specifically to them.  
 In this lesson, I'll walk you through what a mail merge is  
 and why it's so valuable.  
 Placeholders, known as merge fields,  
 tell Microsoft Word where in the document  
 to include information from the data source.  
 You build the main document in Word,  
 inserting merge fields for the personalized content  
 you want to include.  
 When the mail merge is complete,  
 Word will generate a personalized version of the document  
 for each entry in the data source.  
 Using a mail merge can take time to set up,  
 but saves time and energy in the long run.  
 Mail merge is only available  
 on the desktop application feature, not on the web version.  
 It works in conjunction with Outlook and Excel  
 for desktop as well.  
 Consider updating your Microsoft 365 account  
 to be one with access to the desktop applications,  
 so you'll always have access to the mail merge feature.  
 Mail merge is a time-saving tool  
 that will help you create mass communications with ease.  
 Try it out.
