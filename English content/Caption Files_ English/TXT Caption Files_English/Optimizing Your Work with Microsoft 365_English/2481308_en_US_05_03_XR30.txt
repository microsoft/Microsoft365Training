 - [Narrator] Working with outside organizations  
 is a part of collaboration  
 and it's important to make any partnership experience  
 as seamless as possible.  
 In Teams, guests can participate in meetings,  
 chats, and work on documents.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you how to invite external guests  
 and manage the settings and permissions  
 needed to work with them in Teams.  
 To get started, I'll open Teams  
 from the Microsoft 365 homepage.  
 First, I'll select the team I want to add guests to.  
 In that team, I'll select more options  
 to the right of the name of that team.  
 And then I'll select Add member.  
 Here, I'll enter my guest email addresses.  
 When I'm done selecting all the guests,  
 select Add and the guests will be sent an email invitation.  
 A guest will have the label Guest attached to their name  
 wherever it's displayed in Microsoft Teams.  
 You can also check the top of any channel  
 to see how many guests are in it  
 by selecting the information icon in the top right.  
 To close it, select the information icon again.  
 To set specific guest access,  
 select next to the team name for more options.  
 From there, select Manage team.  
 In the Settings tab, select the Guest permissions dropdown  
 to select or clear options or permissions  
 that you want to use.  
 Well done.  
 Now you're ready to add external guests  
 and set specific permissions for them.  
 You'll be collaborating in no time.
