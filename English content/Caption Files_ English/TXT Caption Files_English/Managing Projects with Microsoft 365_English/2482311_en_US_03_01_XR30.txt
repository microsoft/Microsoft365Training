 - [Instructor] When you're managing a project,  
 you'll be tracking lots  
 of moving parts and tasks.  
 Microsoft Project has powerful work management capabilities  
 that can be used by both project managers  
 and team members alike.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you  
 Microsoft Project's key features.  
 The first feature I want to highlight in Project  
 is task dependencies.  
 A project is often made up of tasks  
 that depend on each other.  
 I'll start by opening the August wedding project  
 I've been working on  
 so you can see how Project lists the various pieces  
 that need to come together for the event.  
 For example, the determined budget task is dependent  
 on the discussion with the couple about wedding size,  
 location and scope.  
 Grid view is fine for listing out the tasks,  
 but with dependencies,  
 it's much easier to understand  
 the information using a timeline.  
 This view gives me the timeline  
 of when tasks are due and their dependencies.  
 Once dependencies are created,  
 I can see the critical path.  
 The critical path shows the specific tasks,  
 that if delayed, will delay the entire project.  
 By analyzing a critical path,  
 you can also identify how to shorten the project length.  
 To view the critical path,  
 on the top menu,  
 select Filters and toggle Show Critical Path on.  
 All the tasks highlighted in red need  
 to be completed on time to meet the deadline.  
 Microsoft Project will help you manage large timelines  
 and projects.  
 If you need to identify dependencies  
 or the critical path, check out Microsoft Project.
