 - [Instructor] As a project manager,  
 I'm coordinating multiple projects throughout my day.  
 I need a way to manage my work  
 to achieve maximum productivity.  
 Becoming comfortable in Planner helps me stay on top  
 of my projects on a day-to-day basis.  
 In this lesson, I'm going to show you the easiest way  
 to access the most important parts of Microsoft Planner  
 so you can start managing your plans.  
 I'll start from office.com and select the app launcher  
 in the top left corner.  
 Then open Planner.  
 This opens Planner hub where you'll find all the plans  
 you have access to.  
 The navigation menu on the left is where I look to create  
 a new plan and find tasks assigned to me.  
 I've pinned the June wedding plan and below it is a list  
 of recent plans I've been working on.  
 The recent section shows the plans  
 I've opened most recently.  
 To find all your plans, select all.  
 Finally in the left menu, select assigned to me  
 to see a list of all the tasks that are assigned  
 to your account.  
 By default, my tasks are grouped by progress with buckets  
 for not started, in progress, and completed.  
 Tasks with a date highlighted in red are overdue,  
 making them easy to identify.  
 I can also use the group by dropdown in the top right  
 to sort my tasks by priority.  
 This way I can see which ones I should focus on first.  
 Consider an upcoming event you need to plan.  
 I encourage you to open the Planner app  
 and explore the features to optimize the efficiency  
 of your next event.
