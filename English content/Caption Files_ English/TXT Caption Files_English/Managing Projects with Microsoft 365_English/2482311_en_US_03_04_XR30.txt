 - [Instructor] Once you create a project,  
 The next step is to add tasks.  
 I've found the easiest way  
 is to think of the big pieces first,  
 and then fill in the details later.  
 In this lesson,  
 you'll be able to use Microsoft Project  
 to add tasks, assigned tasks,  
 and set start and end dates.  
 In this example,  
 I'll create a client wedding project.  
 I'll start from Office.com  
 Select the app launcher  
 in the top-left corner and open Project.  
 Note that using Project for the web  
 requires an active subscription  
 to Microsoft Project.  
 Next, I'll select new blank project.  
 On the Project main page,  
 you can see the project name,  
 and three options for grid, board and timeline.  
 And on the right there's filters,  
 and group members and more actions.  
 Grid view shows the list of tasks  
 for the project and the common task properties.  
 Name, quick look, assigned to and duration.  
 To rename the project,  
 I'll select untitled project  
 in the upper-left corner,  
 and I'll enter client wedding.  
 I'll set the start date  
 to the first day of next month.  
 Select the X in the upper right corner  
 to close.  
 Next, I'll add some tasks by selecting  
 add new task and name them.  
 I'll now switch to the board view  
 by selecting board in the top menu,  
 and I can see all the tasks are in bucket one.  
 I'll select bucket one to rename this bucket  
 to catering.  
 I'll then add another bucket for venue  
 by selecting add bucket.  
 I'll drag the venue-related tasks  
 into the venue bucket.  
 Now that the project buckets are set with tasks,  
 I can assign them to members of my team.  
 First, I'll switch back to grid view  
 by selecting grid on the top.  
 Now I can assign tasks  
 using the assigned to column.  
 For the finalized venue task,  
 I'll select the assigned to column,  
 and enter Isaiah,  
 and select them from the dropdown list.  
 A dialogue appears  
 asking whether I want to add Isaiah  
 to the project group.  
 Select add a group,  
 then select create and assign.  
 I'll assign identify a caterer to Lynne  
 by entering her name in the assigned to column,  
 and selecting assign and add.  
 The next I need to add  
 is the duration of each task.  
 The duration is how long I expect  
 the task to take.  
 I'll select the duration column  
 for the have a tasting task,  
 and enter one to set the duration to one day.  
 I'll do the same for the other tasks.  
 Now, when I go back to the board view,  
 I see each task,  
 who it's assigned to,  
 and the number of days to complete.  
 Next, I want to set the start dates.  
 Select timeline on the top menu,  
 and notice that each task  
 begins on the first day of next month.  
 And that the length of the box  
 is set by the duration I entered.  
 I can drag each task to the correct start date,  
 or select it and enter it in the start field,  
 and select X in the upper-right corner to save.  
 Before you start your next project,  
 explore how project can map your tasks,  
 and help you collaborate with your team.
