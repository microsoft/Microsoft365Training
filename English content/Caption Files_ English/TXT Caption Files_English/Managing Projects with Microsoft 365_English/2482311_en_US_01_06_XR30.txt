 - [Instructor] Sharing lists with team members  
 ensures everyone has up-to-date information on all projects  
 and can collaborate more effectively with each other.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you how to ensure  
 people see up-to-date content  
 and collaborate with relevant stakeholders using lists.  
 First, I'll show you how to share a list  
 with a specific person.  
 I'll start from office.com.  
 Select the app launcher in the upper-left corner  
 and open Lists.  
 From here, I'll open Checklist for wedding.  
 In the top ribbon, select Share.  
 I'm going to send this list for review  
 to my collaborator, Lynne, by entering her name.  
 For the message, I'll enter, "Please review, thanks!"  
 I'll select Anyone with the link can edit  
 to restrict access.  
 I'll select Specific people  
 since I only want this link to be accessed by Lynne.  
 Select Apply to save, then select Send.  
 Lynne will receive an email  
 indicating that I shared the checklist.  
 Close the dialogue.  
 To share your list as view only,  
 select the Share button on the top ribbon.  
 I want to change the setting  
 so anyone with the link can view this list.  
 I'll select the Can edit dropdown next to the To field  
 and choose Can view.  
 Now when I select Copy,  
 Lists will create the shareable link to the list  
 that is view only.  
 The link to the page is copied to the clipboard.  
 I can send this link in a chat or email.  
 Sharing lists with colleagues is easy.  
 You can use it to simply inform others  
 with a view-only version,  
 or you can share a list for collaboration with edit access.  
 This week, try sharing one of your lists with a colleague.
