 - [Instructor] Microsoft Project  
 has a wide variety of helpful tools.  
 In order to get the most out of these tools,  
 you need to know what they are  
 and where to find them.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you how to locate key features  
 within Microsoft Project.  
 I'll start from Office.com, select the App Launcher  
 in the top left corner, and open Project.  
 Note that using Projects of the web  
 requires an active subscription  
 to Microsoft Project.  
 The Project homepage is where you'll find all  
 the Microsoft Projects you have access to.  
 At the top, there's a new blank Project button.  
 I can also see two main sections  
 on the homepage: Favorites and Recent.  
 Favorites has all the projects I've tagged as important.  
 I'm currently working on the August Wedding project.  
 I can mark this project as a favorite  
 by hovering over the project and selecting Mark Favorite.  
 As I complete projects,  
 I can un-favorite them by selecting More Options  
 and choosing Remove From Favorites.  
 The Recent panel contains the projects  
 you've opened most recently.  
 When I need to look back  
 on previous projects, Recent helps me find them quickly.  
 As you work with Projects,  
 team members may share their projects with you.  
 You can see shared projects  
 by selecting the Shared With Me tab.  
 Finally, if you want to narrow your search  
 to see just the projects you've created,  
 filter by selecting the Created By Me tab.  
 Now only the projects I've created are displayed.  
 I encourage you to explore the Project interface  
 before creating your first project.  
 You'll be comfortable  
 with this Project management tool in no time.
