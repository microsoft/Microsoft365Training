 - [Instructor] Sometimes you need your message to stand out.  
 A larger font, different colors, or maybe something more,  
 all these make your message clearer.  
 In this lesson, I'll show you how to edit  
 the formatting of your Team's post to highlight your message  
 and make key items more apparent.  
 Since I am responsible for planning a skills conference  
 with a team of people,  
 it will be a great example to show.  
 For this example,  
 I've already opened Teams and created a team to collaborate  
 on an upcoming conference  
 that we're all working on together.  
 I've created a team  
 to streamline our work and communication,  
 but I also want to share some upcoming tasks  
 that need to be completed.  
 I want to use some additional formatting features  
 to add to my post.  
 So I'll go to Announcements and select new conversation.  
 Then select format.  
 From here, I'll change and edit the announcement  
 before I post it.  
 I'll use a heading in bullets  
 to share the action items for the week.  
 The Mention feature is used to get the attention  
 of people or groups for specific action items.  
 Since I want the marketing and PR group  
 to have a draft flyer,  
 I'll mention this group in the first item in my list.  
 I want Joni to set up a call for the team.  
 I can mention her and ask her to set up a call.  
 I'll make this the second item on my list.  
 I need everyone on the team to submit weekly updates,  
 so I need to make that task stand out.  
 So I'll go to the formatting ribbon,  
 select bold, then select change font color, and choose blue.  
 Now, I'll type in a task for everyone.  
 Now, my text really stands out.  
 My post looks good.  
 To send it to the team,  
 I'll select Send and off it goes.  
 Formatting a post is a really simple way  
 to make what you have to say really stand out.  
 Now you can make your messages do more for you.
