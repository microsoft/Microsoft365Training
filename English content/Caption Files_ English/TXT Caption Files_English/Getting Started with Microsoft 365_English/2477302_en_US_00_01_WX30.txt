 - [Narrator] The best workplaces are filled with  
 collaboration, teamwork and shared activities.  
 Positive results come from a team  
 where everyone works towards a shared goal.  
 Each member knows their role and responsibilities,  
 and clear communication  
 makes collaborating something to look forward to.  
 But how do you facilitate that with a modern team?  
 With Microsoft 365, of course.  
 I'm Courtney Hodge, a Program Manager at Microsoft,  
 and I'm passionate about helping people use technology  
 to make their lives easier.  
 In this course,  
 I'll give you the tools to maximize Microsoft Teams  
 to support your communication and collaboration.  
 I'll teach you how to use SharePoint  
 to work with your team and create engaging sites  
 to get people excited about events or programs.  
 I'll show you how to integrate these tools  
 into your team's workflow and how to gain new efficiency  
 in everything you do at work.  
 I don't know about you,  
 but group projects were never my favorite in school.  
 But learning to utilize Microsoft Teams and SharePoint  
 makes working with your team easy and efficient.  
 So if you're ready  
 to take your teamwork to the next level,  
 let's jump right in.
