 - [Instructor] Building a team takes time.  
 You need to transfer or recruit the right members,  
 build relationships and trust each other.  
 On the other hand,  
 creating a team in Microsoft Teams  
 takes hardly any time at all.  
 In this lesson,  
 I'll use an upcoming event I'm working on,  
 the skills conference,  
 to show you how to set up a team,  
 using templates to save even more time.  
 Let's jump in.  
 Once I'm in Teams,  
 I'll select teams from the left menu.  
 Then select join or create a team from the bottom.  
 If you were joining a team  
 that someone else had created,  
 you might be given a code to join a specific team  
 and you'd select join a team.  
 Since this conference  
 doesn't have a team set up already,  
 as the manager, I'll need to create one.  
 So I'll select create team.  
 I can either create a team from scratch  
 or from a template.  
 I see a manage an event template  
 which will work great for this.  
 I'll select that option to get started.  
 Here, Teams will display an overview  
 of the channels and apps associated with that template.  
 Just select next to continue.  
 Next up is the privacy level.  
 Because I don't want anyone to access my team  
 without me inviting them,  
 I'll make it private.  
 For naming the team,  
 I want to be brief, but descriptive.  
 Since I'm planning a conference,  
 I'll name it skills conference.  
 I'll also include a description  
 to give the members a way to know  
 what the team is about.  
 Like all templates,  
 this one comes with pre-made channels.  
 Think of a channel  
 as a place to talk about a specific topic.  
 When I manage events,  
 I need to create channels  
 where the whole team can discuss broad topics  
 and other channels where smaller groups  
 can talk about specific subjects.  
 If I expand customize channels,  
 I can see all the channels for this team.  
 The general channel is automatically created  
 with every team and cannot be deleted.  
 Most of these other channels are useful here,  
 but my team won't be a part of  
 any budget related conversations,  
 so I'll rename that one technology  
 since our conference will be hybrid this year.  
 I can rename the channel by selecting budget,  
 and replacing the channel name.  
 I can save my change  
 by clicking on customize channels.  
 At this point, everything is set up  
 and I'll select create team.  
 Now, it does take a little while  
 for a team to get set up  
 so just be patient  
 and come back a little bit later.  
 As you can see,  
 it doesn't take much effort  
 to create a team.  
 When you're able to create a team,  
 you're in a position to start streamlining communication  
 and collaboration for your next event or project.
