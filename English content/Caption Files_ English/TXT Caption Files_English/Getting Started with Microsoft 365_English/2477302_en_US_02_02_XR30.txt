 - [Instructor] In the workplace,  
 you don't always have the time  
 or a quiet space to take a phone call,  
 so chatting can be a lot more practical.  
 Using the chat feature  
 in Teams allows you to have a flexible conversation  
 when you want to reach out  
 to people in your organization quickly.  
 In this lesson,  
 and quickly communicate.  
 In this example, I'll show you what to do  
 if I wanted to reach out to a teammate  
 just to check in on the status of a meeting,  
 let's go.  
 Once I'm in Teams, I'll select Chat to get started.  
 I have quick access to my recent chats here,  
 but if you want to start a new chat  
 or can't find the chat you need in your recent chats,  
 you can select the New Chat button.  
 As a chat window opens,  
 you can enter who you want to send the chat  
 to, either a specific individual  
 or a group, simply type in the name or email  
 of the person you want to chat with and select their name  
 or email to add them to the chat.  
 From here, you can also add more people.  
 If you want to remove anyone from the message,  
 you can select the X next to their name.  
 At this point, I can begin typing in my message.  
 Isaiah is working with me on an upcoming skills conference.  
 I want to know if Isaiah is planning to come  
 to the planning meeting next week.  
 So I'll just send him a message to ask.  
 I'll type in my message.  
 Then select Send.  
 I've now sent my message,  
 and I can continue working and wait for Isaiah to respond.  
 Once Isaiah responds, I get a notification,  
 and I can also find the activity in chat.  
 Now that you know how to communicate with chats and teams,  
 you can feel confident  
 in reaching out to anyone in your organization.
