 - [Instructor] Isn't it frustrating  
 when you can't change a setting  
 or access a tool you need to do your job?  
 In this lesson,  
 I'll show you how to manage the permissions  
 of your team members  
 so that everyone has the access they need  
 to do their jobs effectively.  
 When managing a team,  
 you need to decide what access your team members should have  
 and you can make sure your team has the appropriate access  
 by using the Manage Team Settings feature.  
 To manage the settings for my team,  
 I'll select More Options then select Manage Team.  
 I can now access the Settings tab.  
 Here, I can manage multiple settings for my team.  
 For now, I'm just going to focus on Member Permissions.  
 To control the team's workflow, I only want owners  
 to be able to change the channels in our team.  
 So in Member Permissions,  
 I'll deselect Allow Members to Create and Update Channels  
 and also deselect  
 Allow Members to Delete and Restore Channels.  
 I'll make sure guests have the same access.  
 Now you know how to adjust the settings  
 to make Teams work in a way that's perfect for your group.  
 Take your time making sure your team members and guests  
 have the access they need and you can feel confident  
 about protecting the teams you own.
