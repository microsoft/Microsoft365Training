 - [Instructor] OneDrive is a useful resource  
 for storing files that you want to share  
 or distribute to others.  
 Even with the default amount of storage space  
 you get with a free OneDrive account,  
 you can share much larger files than you could  
 by sending them over e-mail.  
 Sharing a file with others from OneDrive  
 is a simple matter of generating a link  
 that you can send to them.  
 Start by selecting the file you want to share  
 from your file list,  
 then in the toolbar, click the Share button.  
 In this Send link area that opens,  
 you can enter the e-mail addresses  
 of the people you want to share the file with,  
 to have Microsoft automatically send an e-mail  
 with a link to that file when you click Send.  
 Alternately, you can generate a link by clicking Copy Link,  
 and that creates a link you can copy it to your clipboard  
 by clicking Copy.  
 And then you're free to paste that address  
 into an e-mail you're composing yourself  
 or into an instant messaging program  
 or a webpage you're publishing, and so on.  
 For example, I've already started composing  
 an e-mail message in Microsoft Outlook,  
 and here I'll just right click and choose Paste  
 to paste in that address.  
 And once I'm done, I can click Send  
 to send the e-mail containing this link,  
 and my recipient will be able to click that link  
 to download the file to her own computer.  
 So that's a look at how easy it is  
 to share files from OneDrive.
