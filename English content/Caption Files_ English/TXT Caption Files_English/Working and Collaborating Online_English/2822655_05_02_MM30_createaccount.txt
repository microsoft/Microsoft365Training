 go to onedrive.com and click sign up for free.  
 Then enter the email address you'd like to use.  
 If you don't have an email address  
 you'd like to use for your Microsoft account  
 you can click get a new email address,  
 and choose an outlook.com address.  
 Click next,  
 and create a password.
