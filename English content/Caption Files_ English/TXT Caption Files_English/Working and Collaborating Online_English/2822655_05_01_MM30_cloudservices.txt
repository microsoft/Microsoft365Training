 - Thanks to the internet  
 and access it from another device almost instantly.  
 This is commonly referred to  
 as storing information in the cloud.  
 The cloud is basically a collection of software services  
 that are running in multiple locations on the internet  
 instead of running on a single user's computer.  
 That means that storing content in the cloud,  
 makes it easy to access your information from any device  
 in any location where you have internet access.  
 Some cloud-based services you might've heard of  
 include Dropbox, Apple's iCloud drive,  
 Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive.  
 So for example, instead of saving your important documents  
 and other files to your computer,  
 you can save them to OneDrive,  
 which will allow you to get to them from anywhere.  
 This means that if you're working on a file  
 on your home computer and save it to OneDrive,  
 and later you're on the road with only your mobile phone,  
 you can still access and download that file  
 through OneDrive on your phone.  
 In this chapter, we'll take a look at how to save  
 and access files from OneDrive,  
 but you'll find that the process of doing so  
 is very similar to working with other cloud-based services.
