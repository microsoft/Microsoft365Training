 - Computers keep us in touch with family and friends,  
 and help us do our jobs.  
 The connectedness of our devices allows us to achieve more.  
 And the internet allows you to tap into people  
 and great ideas around the world  
 to collaborate with anyone and bring your ambitions to life.  
 This series of lessons is designed to help you improve  
 your current skills and also learn new skills  
 to help you succeed in the online world.  
 This course introduces you to the skills needed  
 to collaborate online and pursue your ambitions.  
 You might be new to working online,  
 or you may have a lot of experience online with smartphones,  
 but you're learning how to accomplish tasks on laptops  
 or desktop computers.  
 If the thought of working online seems intimidating to you,  
 or if you have felt frustrated with previous attempts  
 to learn these skills,  
 consider this insight from a talented  
 digital literacy coach in Kenya, Grace Nshimiyumukiza.  
 She noted that the roots of getting to knowledge  
 are always hard and tough,  
 but the fruits of it are always enjoyable and sweet.  
 So practice these skills and over time you will succeed.  
 This course is dedicated to getting things done online.  
 We'll see how to connect your network,  
 use email, video chat, and search the internet,  
 as well as how to stay safe while doing so.  
 I'm Garrick Chow and welcome to this course  
 on working and collaborating online.  
 Let's get started.
