 - [Presenter] The internet allows us to communicate  
 with other people in lots of different ways.  
 However, it isn't always safe  
 to communicate with other people online.  
 You don't always know for sure who you're talking to  
 when you're on the internet,  
 and every day online predators  
 pretend to be people they aren't.  
 Here are some tips you can use to keep yourself safer  
 when communicating online.  
 First, listen to your instincts.  
 If someone makes you feel nervous or uncomfortable  
 by asking probing questions  
 or trying to get information out of you,  
 stop communicating with them right away.  
 Most websites and social media sites have tools  
 that you can use to report suspicious activity.  
 Second, limit what you share.  
 Online predators often try to get you  
 to share personal information through emails  
 or other messaging services.  
 Just like you wouldn't share personal information  
 with a stranger on the street,  
 don't share information with strangers online, either.  
 And third, keep your distance.  
 Think twice about meeting someone in person  
 that you have only talked to online.  
 Online predators often use social media  
 to pretend to be someone else  
 by setting up fake profiles using other people's pictures.  
 Even if someone seems friendly,  
 it can be difficult to know for sure who they really are  
 when you're just talking online.  
 Always tell someone you trust  
 when an online stranger asks to meet you in person,  
 so you don't end up in a dangerous situation.  
 Keep these risks and tips in mind so you can stay safe  
 when you talk to people online.
