 - Digital calendar applications  
 are a great way to keep track of meetings  
 and tasks on your own or with the people you work with.  
 Unlike traditional paper calendars or date books,  
 digital calendar software makes it easy  
 to keep your schedule synced with other people,  
 so if you schedule, reschedule,  
 or cancel meetings or appointments,  
 everyone's calendar is updated to reflect that information.  
 There are lots of popular calendar apps  
 used across multiple platforms, including Google Calendar,  
 Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.  
 In this chapter, we'll be focusing on Outlook  
 because in addition to it being  
 a professional calendar application,  
 it's also a full fledged email application  
 and contact manager, so you can easily keep  
 your appointments and other tasks synced between  
 yourself and others in one place.
