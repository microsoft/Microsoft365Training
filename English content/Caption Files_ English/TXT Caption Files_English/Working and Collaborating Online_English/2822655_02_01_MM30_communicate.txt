 - The internet offers a multitude of ways to communicate  
 and stay in touch with others.  
 This includes services like email, instant messaging,  
 website discussion boards, social media,  
 and even voice and video calls.  
 On top of learning how to use these various methods  
 of communication, it's also important  
 to understand when to use them.  
 For example, if you need to ask a coworker  
 a question that requires a time sensitive reply,  
 email might not be the best choice  
 as not everyone checks their email regularly  
 throughout the day.  
 Instead, your company may use an instant messaging service,  
 like Skype or Google Hangouts or Slack,  
 and sending a text-based message through that service  
 may get you a quicker reply.  
 In situations where you can wait a reasonable amount of time  
 for a reply, email is a better choice  
 as the general expectation is that email  
 is not for back and forth conversation in real-time,  
 but instead lets each person be a little more thoughtful  
 about their words and the information they're sharing.  
 Email is also useful to have a written record  
 of your conversations.  
 And of course, for real-time conversations,  
 when you can't be in the same room,  
 you have the option of traditional phone calls  
 or even video-based calls,  
 so you can both see and hear people in real-time.  
 Video calls can make it a little easier to communicate  
 effectively because they allow you to see the expressions  
 on the attendees faces during the call.  
 So again, understanding when to use certain types  
 of services is an important aspect of communicating online.
