00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] When words aren't enough to communicate

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:07.001
an idea, PowerPoint provides a simple visual solution.

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.000
With PowerPoint presentations,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.008
you can add pictures and icons to your slides

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.008
that help illustrate important information.

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:15.007
In this lesson,

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:20.001
I'll show you how to add pictures to your presentations.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.008
In this example, I open PowerPoint to add

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:24.003
to the presentation I'm creating

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.007
for an upcoming job interview.

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.007
You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.001
from the exercise files.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.006
Now that I have my presentation open,

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:38.002
I want to add pictures and icons to some of the slides.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.008
I'll start with the About Me slide.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:45.003
For this slide I chose two content as my layout,

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.004
so it's ready for a picture to be added.

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:52.001
I have several types of content I can add.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:57.004
A table, smart art, icons, pictures from my computer,

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.007
stock images, or even a video from the web.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.005
I'll show you how to view stock images

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:07.006
so you can see what visuals PowerPoint has to offer.

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:10.002
You can type a term in the search bar

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.002
or select from the categories below.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:17.005
I'll type cooperation because I like helping other people.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:22.008
I find an image that I like, select it to add it

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.008
to my presentation.

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.002
Then I select Insert.

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:32.009
And just like that, the picture is on the About Me slide.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.006
Now I want to change the look of my image,

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.004
including its size and location.

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.007
With the image selected,

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:43.002
I can alter its shape and placement.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.009
There's a button that rotates the image using

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.001
the rotation feature, and I can also drag and drop the image

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.009
to a new location.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.001
To alter the size of your image,

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.007
use the corners to keep the proportions the same.

00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:00.007
If you use the sizing options to only make it taller,

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:04.004
or only wider, the proportions of the image will distort.

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:06.003
I'll move on to the next slide.

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.003
I think the software skill slide could benefit

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.005
from the addition of an icon.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.004
I'll select icon.

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:16.008
I'll search for a computer icon.

00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:23.008
Find one that I like, select it, select insert

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.001
and it's added to my slide.

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.002
I can also change the color

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.008
of the icon by right clicking the icon.

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.003
I want to change the fill

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:37.006
or the color of the inner space of the icon.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.004
Once I select the dropdown menu from Graphics, Fill,

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:48.001
I can choose the color I want from these options.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:52.002
I'll make my icon larger so it's easier to see.

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:55.000
Before I finish, I'm going to take another look

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.008
at the design options to see

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:59.009
if there's a better look for my slides.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:08.007
I'll select the design options I like most for each slide.

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.004
Now my presentation looks really great

00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:14.001
with the added picture and icon.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.001
Try out your new skills by adding some visual content

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:20.004
to your presentation to really engage your audience.
