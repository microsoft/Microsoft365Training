00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] Picture this.

00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.001
You just updated your resume to apply for a new job.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.007
All the details look great, except there's one problem.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.003
Your resume's spread over two pages

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:16.005
and the job application asks for one page max.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.001
By adjusting the margins,

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.007
you can keep everything on the same page

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.003
without deleting anything important.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:26.002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to use margins

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:30.000
to fit the content you want in the space you need.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
To get started, download the sample resume

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.004
available in the Exercise Files.

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.001
The first thing you need to do is open the resume.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.009
Since this is such an important document,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.004
make sure to review it closely

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.008
to make sure it has all the necessary information.

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.007
This layout looks good,

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.004
but there's a little bit of text

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.001
running onto the second page.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.009
So to keep everything on one page without deleting anything,

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.003
you want to customize your margins.

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll show you how by going up to the ribbon

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.005
and selecting Layout.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.001
This is where Word displays several options

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.009
for how text is arranged on the page.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.007
You can explore all these features on your own,

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.009
but for now, just select Margins.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.009
From here, you can choose pre-made margins

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.007
or Custom Margins.

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.006
I'll choose Custom Margins to give myself more flexibility.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.001
When I select Margins,

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.008
a window appears showing the current margins.

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:28.009
The bigger your margins are,

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.009
the less room you'll have for text on a page,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.002
but making them smaller will allow you

00:01:34.002 --> 00:01:37.004
to fit more text in the same space.

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.003
Since I need to fit all the text

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.002
onto a single sheet of paper,

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:44.001
these margins need to be smaller.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.009
I'll lower the default margins from one inch

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.006
down to a half an inch.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.005
After selecting OK

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:56.004
to apply the updated margins to your document,

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.006
the resume now fits on one page.

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.005
If you need to adjust the margins again,

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.009
you can always go back into Custom Margins

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.002
and make any changes you need.

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.005
Now you know exactly how to adjust the margins

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:09.005
in a Word document

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.003
and get everything you need on the same page.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.007
You're ready to reformat your resume

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:15.009
or any other document.
