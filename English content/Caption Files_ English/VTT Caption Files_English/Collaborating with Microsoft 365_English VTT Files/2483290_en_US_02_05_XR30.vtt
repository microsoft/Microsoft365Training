00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.004
- Managing multiple sheets could be a mess,

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.000
but with Excel Worksheets

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.001
you can keep your work organized and easy to access,

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:12.001
by adding multiple sheets into a single Workbook.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.001
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.008
how to manage your worksheets more efficiently,

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:21.004
so you can keep your digital workspace free of clutter.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.009
I've created a chart so you can see a visual representation

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.008
of what monthly expenses might look like.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.003
Right now I have a pie chart of my expenses

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:34.004
and one of the sheets within my workbook titled, My Budget.

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.005
The sheet it's in right now is labeled Expenses.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:41.001
And the chart is sitting next to the table of expenses.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.002
But I want it in its own sheet.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.005
In order to do that I will add a new sheet

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.004
by selecting the new sheet button

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.000
at the bottom of the workbook.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.003
A new blank sheet will pop up

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.007
and you'll be able to give it a name.

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.009
I'll name this sheet Pie Chart.

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:01.001
In order to move the pie chart over to this new sheet,

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:05.005
I'll select the chart from the old sheet and cut it.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.008
Then I'll go to the new pie chart sheet

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.005
and choose where I want to place my chart.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.003
I want to place the chart in B2.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:17.001
So I'm going to select that cell then paste the pie chart.

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:21.002
I can now see my chart in the pie chart worksheet.

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.006
In the table of expenses still exist

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.005
in the expenses worksheet.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.001
If I wanted to continue growing this workbook

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.001
I could easily add another new worksheet

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.005
and use that for a guest list, to do's,

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:38.009
or any other aspect that fits within my overall budget.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.000
To keep multiple worksheets organized in the same workbook

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.007
I can change the order of my sheets

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:47.005
by dragging and dropping the tabs.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.004
Now that you know how to build out a workbook

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:53.001
to include individual worksheets,

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.007
gathering, organizing and referencing all that data

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.002
will be much easier.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.008
Whether you're creating a new budget

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.003
or need to keep track of job searches.

00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.008
I encourage you to make the most of your workbooks

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.007
by creating individual worksheets

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:08.008
for each element of your project.
