00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] When you send an email,

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.000
you're starting a digital dialogue.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.006
So the person you're sending your email to

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.004
will need to know who you are and how they can respond.

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.006
Adding an email signature is an easy way

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.001
to sign off your emails

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.005
that you can use at the end of all your emails.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.004
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.009
how to keep your sign-offs consistent

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.000
and your communication going strong with email signatures.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.001
For this example, I'm in the middle of a job search.

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.002
I may be sending multiple emails

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.003
as I apply for each new job.

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.000
Before I write my emails,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.007
I want to create an email signature

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:41.002
so I can have a standard ending to all my job search emails.

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.009
First, in the top-left corner of office.com,

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:50.007
select the app launcher and open Outlook.

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:56.000
From here, I'll go to Settings at the top right.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here you can change the look of your inbox,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.008
but I need to go to View all Outlook settings

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.008
to access more options.

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:08.003
Next I go to Compose and reply,

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.001
then the Email signature section.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:13.002
This is where I create the signature that I want

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.007
for all my job search-related emails.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:20.001
Here I'll add my name, my email address, and my phone number

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.005
in case someone needs to reach me right away.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.002
Then I'll give my email signature a name.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:29.004
I'll call it Job search so I can reuse it later.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.009
There are a lot of options in Compose and reply.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.005
I can select a default signature,

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.007
alter how I format messages,

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.009
and a lot more.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.004
For simply setting up an email signature,

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.004
you don't need to worry

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.003
about diving too deep below this first section.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.006
I'll save my email signature

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.004
and close out of here by selecting the X.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:58.002
Now that I have my email signature set up and saved,

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.007
it's ready to use.

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.004
So I'll select New message.

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.005
At the bottom of the window with my new email,

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.006
I'll select more options,

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:11.001
then select Insert signature,

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.001
and select the Job search signature,

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.006
and the signature will be added to the new email.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:20.000
Now you know how to create a signature

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.005
to add to any email you compose,

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:25.008
saving time when you want to share the same information

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.004
at the end of your emails.
