- [Joni] Scrolling through an endless inbox

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.004
for that one email you need can feel like

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.009
trying to find a needle in a haystack,

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.000
but Outlook has a search tool that makes it easy

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.002
to find any email.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:17.001
In this lesson I'm going to show you how to search

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.004
your email inbox.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.009
I'll start in my Outlook inbox.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.005
In this example, I have an interview for a job,

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.000
and the company has asked me to create a PowerPoint

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.007
presentation for my interview.

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.000
The company sent me an email with the presentation

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.004
instructions but I can't remember all of the requirements.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.005
To be able to know exactly what's expected of me,

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.006
I'll need to search for this email in Outlook.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.004
I remember the email had the word presentation in it.

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.005
So I'll go to the search box and type in

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:54.007
the word presentation then select Enter.

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.004
This searches my email for all the emails

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.005
with the word presentation.

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.002
Here's the email I was looking for.

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.008
I'll open it to see the requirements.

00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:11.005
As you can see Outlook has also highlighted the search word.

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.002
If you wanted to narrow your search to only find emails

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.008
that have attachments, you could use Filter.

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:21.000
First, I'll navigate back to my Inbox.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'll select the Filter button above my mailbox,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.007
select Attachments, and now my mailbox is only showing

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.002
emails that have attachments

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:35.006
Now that you know how to search your email,

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.006
you'll be able to quickly find any email

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:41.007
even if it's buried deep in your inbox.
