00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Things change quickly,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:06.002
and you need spreadsheets that adapt just as fast.

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.008
With a few key features in Excel,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.008
you can edit and manage your data easily.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.001
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to use Excel

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.008
to keep track of new information

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.005
and remove old information

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:22.004
so that you can keep your data up to date and useful.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.005
I'll start by opening the sample budget

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.004
that you can find in the exercise files.

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:29.003
So now that I can see my budget,

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.002
I want to see how it's changed

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:33.007
between this month and last month.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.000
To see this in my table,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.009
I need to add columns.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.005
To add a column between the A and B columns,

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.008
I select the B column and right-click.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.002
A menu with several options open.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.003
I want to select Insert Columns.

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.003
A column is added between A and B.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.007
The data in the columns is still the same,

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.008
but everything has shifted to the right.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.007
Next, I'll name the new column to keep my data organized.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:05.009
I'll title the new column Last Month.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.006
And I'll name my amount column This Month.

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:18.002
I can now add data from the previous month to my table.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.008
If, instead, you want to remove an entire column,

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.000
select the column you want removed,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.005
right-click,

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:30.000
and select Delete Columns.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.007
The entire column is removed.

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:36.002
Adding and removing rows uses similar steps.

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:40.004
Say you want to add a row between row six and row seven.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:43.002
First, select row seven,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.006
right-click,

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.003
then select Insert Rows.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:50.007
A new row has been added,

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.004
which I can use to add a new expense.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:55.009
To delete a row,

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.003
first select the row you want removed,

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.000
right-click,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.008
and select Delete Rows.

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:08.009
The entire row is removed.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.003
Suppose you want to add a title to your expenses table.

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.006
First, add a row above your table for the title.

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:20.008
This new row has sales for each column in my table.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:22.009
For my title, I only need one cell,

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.006
so I can use the merge feature

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:28.004
to combine these different cells into a single cell.

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.008
Merge will only keep the data in the upper left cell,

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.006
so I need to place my title

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.008
in the cell farthest to the left.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:41.003
Here, I'll type My Monthly Expenses Table.

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:46.005
Next, select all the cells you want to merge.

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:50.000
Go to the Alignment section in your ribbon,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.008
select Merge &amp; Center.

00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:57.001
Merge &amp; Center will merge the two cells into one cell

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.004
and center the text.

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:03.001
I can also select Unmerge Cells here.

00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:05.003
Now that you know how to add, delete,

00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:08.003
merge and unmerge columns and rows,

00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:10.008
you have the flexibility you need

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:13.004
to manage your ever-changing data.
