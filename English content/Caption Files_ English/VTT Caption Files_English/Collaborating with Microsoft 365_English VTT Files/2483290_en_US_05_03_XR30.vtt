00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.003
- [Instructor] Have you ever finished

00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:04.000
describing the steps of a complex task

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.009
only to realize it would've been simpler

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.005
to arrange the steps in another order?

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:09.006
In this lesson,

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.003
I'll show you how to apply slide layouts

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.000
and change the slide order

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.007
so your PowerPoint presents and flows perfectly.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.005
In this example, I open PowerPoint

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.007
to start adding to the presentation I'm creating

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:23.008
for an upcoming job interview.

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.008
You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.003
from the exercise files.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:32.006
I already have two slides created,

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.002
and I want to add a new slide

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.002
that shares some information about myself.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.009
I'll choose a title and content slide

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.001
to show this information.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.008
I'll title it About Me.

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.008
Then, I'll add a few highlights to introduce myself

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.003
and my background.

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:54.003
I love helping people.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.004
I've recently completed a customer service training.

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.001
Now that I see the slide,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.001
I think I'd like to change the layout

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.002
to leave room to add a picture later.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:09.002
I can select Layout to see my options.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:13.008
I'll change the current layout to Two Content.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:18.005
Hmm, this slide order doesn't seem right.

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.006
I think I want the About Me slide

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:23.002
to go in front of my skills slide

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:27.000
so my audience gets to know me before my skills.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.009
To change the slide order,

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.006
I'll select View

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:34.006
and make sure I'm in the Normal view setting.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.009
In the Normal view setting,

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.001
I can see the image of my slides

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.002
on the slide and the navigation pane.

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.004
I can go to the navigation pane

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.003
and select the About Me slide,

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:50.005
then drag and drop it above my skills slide.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.001
My slides are now in an order that makes sense.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.005
So that's it.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.006
Now, you can change the slide layout and the slide order.

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:03.007
Use this skill to reframe how you share information

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:06.004
in any of your PowerPoint presentations.
