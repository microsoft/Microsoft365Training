00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Narrator] When you're searching for a job,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.008
you're likely spending valuable time

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.003
thinking about your resume, or CV.

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.002
You might even want to take it to the next level

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.006
and give your resume a brand new professional look.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:16.001
With Styles, there's a quick and easy way to do just that.

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.004
Adjust the font, look and color

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.000
of the different parts of your documents.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.005
I'm going to show you

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.000
how to make your documents look their best

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.008
and stand out from the rest.

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.003
To get started, download the sample resume

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.005
available in the Exercise Files,

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.008
and I'll walk you through how to customize your resume.

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.003
Here, you can see I have the file open in Word.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.006
I use the template to create the resume,

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.005
but I want to make some slight adjustments

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.009
so it looks just right.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.007
To quickly see what different styles are available,

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:49.005
I'll go to the Style tab on the ribbon.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.002
So many great options.

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.009
I want to start by changing the style

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.001
for my school in the Education section.

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.004
So I'll just highlight that portion of text.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.000
Head back to the ribbon.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.005
Select the Style tab. There are several options in styles.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:12.007
Notice the differences in font color, size

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:16.006
and other text formats, like Emphasis or Bold?

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:20.009
Since I'm adjusting my school to add focus to it,

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.001
I'll choose Heading 3.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.002
As you can see,

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.008
Word changes the highlighted text to match the style.

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.004
Now, there are a lot of options to choose from

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.007
in the Styles dropdown,

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:36.005
but you might not find the perfect fit you're looking for.

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.008
If you still aren't finding the perfect fit,

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.003
you can try to create your own style.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:44.003
I'll change the style for the name.

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.002
With my name already highlighted,

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:50.005
I'll change the font color and make it blue.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:53.007
And then I'll also put it in Italics.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:57.001
With that perfect font, color and style picked out,

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.008
just head back to Styles

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:05.006
and then choose Create New Style from Formatting.

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:13.001
Give that style a name, and I'll call it Blue Italics

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.000
and click OK.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.004
And now, my new original style

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:19.008
will be ready to use elsewhere.

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:21.006
And that's all there is to it.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.002
Styles can help quickly change

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:25.007
multiple formatting options all at once,

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:28.009
standardizing them across your entire document.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.000
Practice your skills by changing the style

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of some text in your documents to elevate their look.
