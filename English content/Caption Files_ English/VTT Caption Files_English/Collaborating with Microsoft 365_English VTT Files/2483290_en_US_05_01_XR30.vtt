00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Joni] When you need to present

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.004
important ideas visually, PowerPoint is the tool

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.004
that takes your communication to another level.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.005
In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:12.002
how to create a presentation in PowerPoint and add

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.000
your first slide.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.001
First I'll open PowerPoint.

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.000
And in this example, I've been selected

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.001
for a remote job interview and was asked to

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.005
create a PowerPoint presentation to showcase my skills.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:28.007
So next, I'll select New blank presentation.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.000
Before going too far I want to make sure

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've renamed and saved my presentation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I can see the save status next to the title

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.004
of the presentation, and it is saved.

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:43.000
If I select the title, a new window opens,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.003
and I can rename the presentation Interview slides.

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.003
After I renamed the presentation,

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.008
I can select anywhere outside the window and it will close.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:57.005
I want to focus on adding content at the moment.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.002
And so I'm going to close Designer.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:03.003
The first slide is a title slide.

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:07.004
So I'll write the title, Skills overview.

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.009
Then I'll add my name under the title

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.001
so my audience will remember me.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:17.000
I now have the first slide in my presentation and I'm ready

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.007
to add more slides.

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:22.000
Now, you know how to create a PowerPoint presentation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.004
Go ahead and try to add a slide to your own presentation.
