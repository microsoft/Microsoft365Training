00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Host] Believe it or not,

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.002
there are still many reasons

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:07.002
why a file living on your computer, tablet or phone

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.009
needs to jump off the screen and onto a sheet of paper.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.006
Perhaps you need to add a handwritten signature

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.003
to an agreement or give a hard copy of your resume

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.008
to a hiring manager.

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:22.009
In these situations, you just need to press print.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.002
After watching this lesson,

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.003
you'll know the steps to print your word documents,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:31.007
bringing them off the screen and into the physical world.

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.000
A common document that needs to be shared physically

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.005
is a job resume.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.005
So I'll walk you through how to print using a sample resume.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.007
To begin, download the sample resume

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.003
available in the exercise files and open it up.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.004
I won't be able to make any changes

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.004
once this resume is printed on a piece of paper.

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.001
So I want to take a moment to review my resume

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.003
and make sure I'm ready to press print.

00:00:56.003 --> 00:01:00.001
Once I'm certain that this document is exactly how I want,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.004
I'll go to the ribbon and select file.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.005
From here, you can choose to create a new file,

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:11.008
open an existing file, save, share, export, or print.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.006
To hold a copy of this document in my hand,

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:20.003
I'll need to choose print and then print this document.

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.008
Now a new screen appears that displays an image

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.007
of what the printout will look like,

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.008
as well as additional options and settings on the left.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.007
Next, make sure the destination is set

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.004
for the correct printer.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:35.005
With the destination set correctly,

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.004
and the preview looking right,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.007
you are just about ready to print.

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.002
Leave the pages option to all.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:44.006
If you had a multi-page document,

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:46.005
you'd use this option to specify

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.007
which pages you wanted to print,

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.005
but that's not right for my resume.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.006
So I'll leave it as one.

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.003
At this point, if you select print,

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.009
the printing process will be underway.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.000
If you want to go beyond a standard print

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.008
you can select print using system dialogue,

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:04.009
where you can change the layout of your document

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.005
from portrait to landscape, print only specific pages,

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.000
or make any other advanced adjustments.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.009
Printing your documents is less common with PDFs and email,

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.002
but it's still a great way to make sure your document

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.004
looks exactly how you created it.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.007
When you print a document,

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.007
you're bringing your digital work into the physical world

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.000
and that's amazing.
