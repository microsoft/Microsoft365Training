00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Sometimes an email can say it all,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.009
but for those times

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.007
when you need to say a bit more,

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.008
attaching a file can help you add

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.004
even more important information.

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:12.002
In this lesson,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.003
I'm going to show you how to use Outlook

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.003
to send attachments

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.001
so that you can easily include

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.001
relevant files with your email

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.003
To show you how to use attachments,

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:23.008
I'm going to use the example

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:26.005
of trying to look for a new job.

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.002
I heard of a new opportunity,

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.004
and I'll need to attach my resume

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.000
to an email to share it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.008
First, I'll open Outlook.

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.004
From my Outlook inbox,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.005
I'll open the email that I need to reply to.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.009
I'll select reply,

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.005
and then I'll select add attachment.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.002
A menu opens to help me find

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.007
the file I'm looking for.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.004
Since I saved my document to Microsoft's

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.006
file hosting service OneDrive,

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.006
I'll select browse cloud locations.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.003
I'll navigate to the file I'll need.

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:04.006
Select it and select next.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.009
Now I can choose if I want to share a link

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.000
to my file or a copy of it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If I was working on editing the file

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with someone else,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.003
I would share a link,

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.005
that way we could work on the file together,

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.006
and see updates in real time.

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:18.009
Since I'm sharing my resume

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.003
with a potential employer,

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.008
and we don't need to collaborate on the document,

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.005
I will choose attached as copy.

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.003
My resume is now attached to my email.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.001
I'm ready to send it.

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.006
So I select send and my email and attachment

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.003
are on their way.

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.001
Try adding an attachment to your next email.
