00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.008
- [Instructor] Data is everywhere in the digital world.

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:07.009
With so much information on your screens and in your life,

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.005
it can be tough to keep track of everything.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.007
What's great about Excel is that once you have your data

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:17.002
on a table, it's much easier to organize

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.005
and locate what you're looking for.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.009
In this lesson,

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.007
I'm going to show you how to sort your data in a table

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.001
to find the information you need.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.009
To get started, download and open

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.002
the sample budget exercise file in Excel.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.009
Now that I have the document open,

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.004
you can see that expense items

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.007
and amounts are already formatted as a table,

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.008
but they're not in any particular order.

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.009
I want to see my most expensive expense.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.009
So I'll need to use sort and filter.

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:55.003
Sorting allows you to organize the data in a specific order.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.006
To sort my data, I'll go to the header of my table

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.006
and select the Filter and Sort button

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.000
on the column I want to sort.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.007
In the menu that appears,

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:09.003
I can choose from a variety of ways to sort the data.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.009
Because I want to see my most expensive items first,

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.009
I'll select Sort Largest to Smallest.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.004
Now, the expenses are sorted

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.005
from the highest expense to the lowest expense.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.008
Sorting in this way can come in handy

00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:26.003
when prioritizing which expenses

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.004
have the highest impact on a monthly budget.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.007
In addition to sorting expenses by cost,

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.004
you can also sort them by name.

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.007
To sort by name, return to the top of the items column,

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:44.008
select Filter and Sort, and choose Sort A to Z.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, instead of the list being in order

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.001
from most expensive to least,

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.000
the budget items are sorted alphabetically.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.001
This is useful if you have a long list of items

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.004
and you want to find one by name.

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.003
You can also filter the data in a table.

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:04.002
Filtering allows you to more easily see the data

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:08.005
you're looking for by temporarily limiting what's visible.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.009
For example, I can filter my table

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.003
to only show the expenses that are $200.

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:17.009
Simply select the Filter and Sort button,

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.002
deselect Select All,

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:25.007
and select $200 and select Apply.

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:29.004
This will show only the expenses that are $200.

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.001
I can select

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:36.002
Select All to select all of my expenses again.

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.001
Now that you know how to sort and filter data in Excel,

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.003
you can arrange any type of data

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:42.009
in a way that works for you.
