00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] The first step to understanding data

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.000
is organizing it in a spreadsheet,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.005
but in order to understand what the data really means,

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.009
you'll want to learn how to visualize it.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.002
It can be difficult to get a full picture

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.005
of monthly expenses just by looking at a worksheet.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.005
In this example, I'll bring that data into a chart,

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:22.002
so that I can get clarity on key trends,

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.001
how much money is being spent,

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.007
what can be done differently in the future?

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.008
In this lesson, I'm going to show you how

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.001
to use Excel's charts to visualize data,

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.007
adding a different view and a new understanding

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.001
to simple numbers on a spreadsheet.

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.009
So, go ahead and download the sample budget workbook

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.009
and the exercise files, so that you can follow along.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.004
The first thing to do is select the data.

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.005
I know I want to have a clearer understanding

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.000
of my monthly expenses, so I'll highlight

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.004
my monthly expenses table.

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:59.001
I'll select and drag to include the full range.

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:04.000
With the data selected, go to the ribbon and select insert.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.007
A new ribbon has opened here, with a few options.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.003
I'm looking for a visual representation

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.003
of how my money is spent each month,

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.007
so a pie chart would be the best choice for me.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:20.001
So, I'll select pie chart and select 2-D Pie.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.005
We're going to make my chart a little smaller,

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.008
so we can see it.

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:29.000
You can also drag and drop your chart to move it around.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
From here, I can see how much of my monthly expenses

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
fall into each category.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.002
Now, that I've made my data visual in a chart,

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.000
it's easy for me to see if any of my expenses

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.007
need to be adjusted.

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:45.004
Looking at how much I spend in entertainment,

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.006
I think that might be a piece of my budget

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.000
where I can make some adjustments.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.009
Now that you know how to add a chart,

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.007
you can make visual representations

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.006
of your own data in a worksheet,

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:58.006
or try adding a chart to the sample budget.

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.008
Experiment with different types of charts

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.002
to see what they look like

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.007
and visualize your data in new ways.
