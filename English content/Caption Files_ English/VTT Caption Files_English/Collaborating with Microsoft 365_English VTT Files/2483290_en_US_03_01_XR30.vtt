00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Instructor] Accessing, organizing, and using notes

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:07.000
in a paper notebook can be really challenging.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.009
OneNote is a digital notebook

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.005
that makes your information work for you.

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:12.007
In this lesson,

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:16.003
I'm going to walk you through creating a notebook in OneNote

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:20.000
so that you can keep your information organized, useful,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.003
and accessible from anywhere, anytime.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.001
For job seekers, it's necessary

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.002
to keep track of detailed information

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.002
on each job you search for.

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.000
In this example,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.008
I'll show you how to create a notebook in OneNote

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.006
to help with that important task.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.008
First, in the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.004
select the app launcher and open OneNote.

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:43.007
Now that I've opened OneNote,

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.009
it's time to create a new notebook.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.007
Select the Add new notebook option

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.006
and give the new notebook a name.

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:56.007
I'll name my notebook My job search notes,

00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:02.006
and then I'll select Create.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:04.002
After the notebook is created,

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:08.001
it's time to organize content by adding sections.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.001
When you open a brand-new notebook,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.006
you'll see this alert that the notebook is empty

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.003
with no sections.

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.003
In OneNote, every notebook is made up of sections

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.001
and each section has pages.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.002
Think of these sections like dividers

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:25.004
between loose-leaf papers and a physical binder.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:29.004
To add a section, I'm going to select Add section.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.006
A window opens, asking for a section name.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.002
Let's say I'm looking for two types of jobs,

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.001
one working as an office assistant

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.000
and the other as a teaching assistant.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.002
These are different jobs.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:41.008
So I'll separate my notebook

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.002
into an office assistant section

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.004
and a teaching assistant section.

00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.002
I'm most interested in the office assistant job,

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.004
so I'll start with that section.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:55.008
I'll name this section office assistant and select OK.

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.000
So now I have a new section in my notebook

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.001
called office assistant.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.009
When a new section is created,

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.006
OneNote automatically adds a page called Untitled Page,

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.000
which I'll update here

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
to specify what type of notes I'll include.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.009
Let's say job details.

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.007
Now that this page is set up,

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.007
I'm ready to take notes on the job opportunity.

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.004
Now that you know how to create a notebook

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:21.008
and sections within it,

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:24.000
you can make your own digital notebooks.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.009
These will be places

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.001
where you can keep notes on job searches,

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.008
classes you're taking,

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.003
or which new series you want to binge watch.
