00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] If you're starting from scratch

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.000
every time you create a document,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you might feel like you're reinventing the wheel.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.001
But with OneNote,

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:13.000
you can easily create consistent documents using templates,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.005
tailoring your notebook to your needs in no time.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:19.002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create pages

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.006
to store information in your notebook

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.006
and also how to use templates to save you time.

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.004
In OneNote, you can create notebooks,

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.004
which are made up of sections.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:30.008
Each section contains pages

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:34.000
and that's where you'll document your notes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
First, I'll open my notebook.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.008
So to create a new page,

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:44.004
I'll select Add page at the bottom of my notebook.

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.001
We can start here.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.007
Now, I will add the information

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.000
I want to keep track of for each job,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.003
like the job title, company name, how to apply, and more.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:01:00.000
I'll select where I want to add content and add the content.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You can also format any text you add

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.007
to make it stand out.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:10.005
Here, I'll make the application due date larger,

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.004
in bold,

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:16.006
and in a different color to really make it stand out.

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.008
I also want to add a table at the bottom of this page

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:24.002
to compare the pros and cons of this job.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:27.005
First, I select where I want my table to go.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.008
I select Insert,

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:31.008
select Table,

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:35.003
and highlight the size that I need for my table.

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:38.000
I'll choose two rows and two columns.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.007
The table is inserted,

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:44.002
and I'll label the columns Pros and Cons.

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:56.009
I'll also add bullets by selecting bullets.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.008
So the information I enter

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.000
will be neatly organized at my table.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.008
Now that I have a design for my notes,

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:09.005
I'll name this page Job search template.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:13.005
The title goes to the top of each page.

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:17.001
Next, I will replicate this Job search template page

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.007
for each job I am interested in

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.009
by right-clicking on the page,

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.002
selecting Move/Copy from the menu that appears,

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.001
and then choosing Copy.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.004
I now have a duplicate

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.005
of my Job search template page.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:33.008
From here, I'll rename this page

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.009
based on a job I'm interested in.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.004
Now, I'll enter the information

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.005
that I have for this job search, like the job title,

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.009
the company name, and how to apply.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.002
I can come back and fill in the other details

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.005
when I have them.

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:52.007
Now, you have the skills to create custom templates

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:54.009
and pages in your own notebooks.

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.008
Try it out.
