00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Instructor] A paper notebook is bound by its cover,

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.000
but a digital notebook goes far beyond that,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.002
building bridges to the rest of the internet.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.003
With OneNote, you can use your notebook

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.002
as a portal to the worldwide web.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.001
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.003
how to easily connect your notebook to any website

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.003
by adding links.

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.000
This can be really useful

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.004
when adding key information like a company's website

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.005
in your job search.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:33.000
First, I'll open My job search notes notebook.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.007
So here I am in the notebook

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.003
where I'm keeping notes about my job search.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.008
I have created a template I can use

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:43.000
to keep track of each job I'm interested in.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.005
I'm curious about jobs I might find at Microsoft.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.008
So I'll use the template to create a page

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:52.004
for my job search at Microsoft.

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:57.007
I'll rename my page Microsoft search.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.009
I'm not ready to search or make notes yet,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.007
but I know there is a career site at Microsoft,

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.004
so I want to link my notes

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.008
directly to that useful information.

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:11.004
I can do this by adding a link to the page.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:15.003
If I already know the web address, I can add it directly.

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:20.009
First I want to select where the link will go on my page.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll select Insert and Insert Link,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.003
I'll type in the text I want to display for the link,

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.005
and then type in the web address,

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:37.000
and now I'll select Insert.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.003
I can also go directly to the website in my browser

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:41.008
and select the web address,

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.000
then copy and paste it on my page in OneNote.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.005
Now you can add links to pages in your notebooks

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.007
to make more dynamic connections

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.002
than you could with a paper notebook alone.
