00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.007
- If you asked me to teach you to do

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.008
one single thing in Excel

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:09.009
I would want to show you how to create and format tables.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.004
It's such an important skill.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.004
Once you're comfortable with inputting data into a table

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.004
you'll be ready to start using all the powerful tools

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.005
and functions in Excel.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to get started

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.004
with tables so that you can begin using Excel's

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.004
excellent calculating capabilities.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.002
The first thing to do is open Excel

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.002
from the app launcher on Office.com.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.005
Next I'll need to create a workbook.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:41.001
A workbook is a file that contains one or more worksheets

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:42.008
to help organize data.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.002
Think of it as the digital version of a physical workbook,

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:50.000
a single place to keep several related sheets together.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.001
In Excel, there are a few different ways

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.003
to start a new workbook.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.007
I can choose from templates or create a blank workbook.

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.000
In this lesson I'm going to create a new budget

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.002
as an example.

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:07.007
So I'll start from scratch and select new blank workbook.

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:10.001
Once the workbook is created,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:14.003
I'm going to name and then save the new workbook right away,

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.003
so I won't lose any of my work.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.008
Select the file name to open a window

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.009
where you can change the name

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.005
and the location of where it'll be saved.

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.008
I'm going to name this My Budget.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.006
Now that I've named and saved my workbook

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.000
I want to take a look at my worksheet.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.001
Creating a workbook automatically creates sheet one,

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.007
a blank spreadsheet that's ready to go.

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.005
You can create additional sheets

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.003
by selecting the plus sign at the bottom,

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.002
but for now I only need one sheet.

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:52.001
To rename a sheet, hover over the tab at the bottom left

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:56.007
of the screen and right click sheet one.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:00.002
A menu will open with a number of actions to choose from.

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:03.008
Select rename, now a new window opens

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.002
asking to rename the sheet.

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:09.009
I'm going to rename the sheet Expenses.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.008
Then select Okay.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.007
Notice the tab that was labeled sheet one

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.001
is now labeled Expenses.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.005
Now that I've renamed my sheet, I'm ready to create a table.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.007
First I'll label the column so that I know where to put

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.008
each piece of information.

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:26.008
In this sample,

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.008
I want to track my monthly expenses.

00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.009
So I'll label two columns,

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.001
one column for types of monthly expenses

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.002
and another for their amounts.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:41.004
To label the first column, select the A1 cell

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:44.007
and type monthly expenses.

00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.004
For the second column,

00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:50.009
select the B1 cell and name it amount.

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.003
I want to be able to see the full title

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:56.001
for my monthly expenses.

00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.000
So I'll just adjust the column width,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.003
to see all of my text.

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:03.000
Now that I have headers for the information

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.001
I'm going to put into my table,

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:07.006
I can start adding data to my table.

00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:11.002
I have a number of expenses to categorize and keep track of.

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:15.006
So I'll type these categories under monthly expenses.

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:17.008
I'll start with housing.

00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:21.007
Next, I'll enter the amount I spend for housing each month

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:23.003
in my second column.

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:27.009
I select cell B2 and type in the amount.

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.006
Now that I've added housing to my table,

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:34.004
I'll do the same thing for the rest of my monthly expenses.

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.003
Now that I've input my data

00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:40.008
I can make the table easier to read using format as table.

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:44.007
I'll select all the cells of my table, including the titles.

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.000
Then in the styles portion of the ribbon

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.002
select format as table.

00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:51.004
This opens several formatting options

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.001
for tables I could use.

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.002
I'll choose the alternating colors format

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:59.004
because it makes it easier for me to read each line.

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:02.007
Since my table has titles, or headers, at the top

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.001
I'm going to make sure to leave

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.001
my table has headers selected.

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:10.005
I now have a budget that is formatted the way that I want

00:04:10.005 --> 00:04:12.001
and is ready to use.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.000
Now that you know how to create and format a table

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.006
you can give it a try with your own data.
