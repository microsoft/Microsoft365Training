00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Joni] Have you ever witnessed a presentation

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.006
that was so text-heavy,

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.004
you didn't know where to focus your attention?

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.001
Not a fun experience.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.007
Formatting texts into different fonts and colors

00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:12.007
can help your audience clearly understand

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.007
your presentation's message.

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:18.000
In this lesson, I'll show you how you can use PowerPoint

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.004
to change the appearance of your presentation's text

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.006
so that your audience can keep their focus

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:26.000
on the most important information.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.008
In this example,

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.002
I open PowerPoint to add to the presentation

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.001
I'm creating for an upcoming job interview.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.005
You can follow along by downloading the sample presentation

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.005
from the Exercise Files.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.007
Now that I have my presentation open,

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.009
I want to change the font color,

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:46.009
so I'll select change font color from the menu,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:50.007
then choose the color I want

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:55.000
and watch my highlighted text change to that color.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.003
Next, I want to italicize the text.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.004
With the text highlighted,

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:05.001
I'll select italics from the menu.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.000
Looks great.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.003
Now you can alter the look of any text you add

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.005
to a PowerPoint to help your presentation stand out.
