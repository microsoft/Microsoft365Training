00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] Keeping a consistent composition

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.007
throughout a PowerPoint presentation

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.004
allows your audience to focus

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.006
on the important ideas you're presenting

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.002
without getting distracted.

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:11.008
In this lesson I'm going to show you

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.009
how Designer can help you

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.002
create a consistent look throughout your presentation

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.003
keeping your audience's attention

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.006
on your PowerPoint's content,

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.003
not its composition.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:26.004
So first I'll open my presentation in PowerPoint.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:27.007
You can follow along by downloading

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:28.008
the sample presentation

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.002
from the exercise files.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.000
In this example,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.008
I've already created a presentation

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:35.001
that I've been asked to prepare

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.000
for an upcoming interview.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.001
Now, I want to change the look

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.002
of the presentation by using Designer

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.005
to get started.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:43.002
Now that I'm in my presentation,

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.004
I'll select Designer.

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:46.008
Wow.

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.009
Look at all of these different looks.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.007
I'll find a design I like

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.005
and choose it.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.001
Now that I've chosen a design,

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.009
I can add a new slide.

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.004
I'll select the dropdown

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.002
beside the New Slide icon,

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:03.006
then I can choose the layout

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.007
of the slide I want to add.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.005
I'll add a Two Content slide,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.000
giving me a layout with space

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
for the title and two types of information.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm going to add a new title

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.003
and name this slide, Software skills,

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:22.007
then add text in one of the content sections.

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.003
By using Designer,

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.007
my entire presentation will have a consistent look

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.001
that will keep my audience's attention

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.005
on my skills.

00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:33.009
I encourage you to explore design ideas

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.001
and choose a look for your presentations

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.008
that will wow your audience.
