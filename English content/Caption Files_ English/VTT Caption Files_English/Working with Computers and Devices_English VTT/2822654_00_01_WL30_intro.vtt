in helping you to connect, learn, engage with your community

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.001
and create a more promising future.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.008
Working with computers can open doors

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.004
for opportunities at work,

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.002
connect you with friends or family,

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.008
spray your creativity, and expand your career horizons.

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:19.003
This series of lessons is designed

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.005
to help you improve your current skills

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.002
and also learn new skills to help you succeed

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.000
in the digital world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.003
We'll start with a look at computer and device basics

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.001
and find out what makes a computer a computer.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.009
We'll look at how to use the operating system

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.000
to open, create, save, and otherwise manager your files,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.004
applications, and projects.

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:41.003
Then we'll look at how to connect peripherals

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:45.000
like Bluetooth devices and external storage devices.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.008
And we'll also explore productivity software applications

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:52.002
for work or personal use with tools like Word and Excel.

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:53.003
If you're new to computers

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.003
or have always felt a mild anxiety,

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.007
or even dread when you've sat down in front of a computer,

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.002
this course is for you.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.008
We're going to avoid technical jargon

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.008
and discuss everything in easy to understand terms,

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.003
all while building your knowledge level

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.002
from a foundation of the very basics.

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:10.003
I'm Garrick Chow and welcome to this course

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.005

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.004
Let's get started.
