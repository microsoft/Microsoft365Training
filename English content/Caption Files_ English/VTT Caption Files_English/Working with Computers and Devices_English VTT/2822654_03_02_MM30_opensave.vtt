00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] Just about any time

00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:02.008
you work in an application

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:04.007
in which you are creating, editing,

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.003
or otherwise modifying some kind of content,

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:10.003
you'll be producing and saving your work as files.

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.000
For example, when you type up a report in a word processor,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.002
the report is saved as an individual file,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.001
which you can then reopen in the application

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.007
to continue working on it.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.000
Or if you're editing a video

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.006
you shot of a grade school recital,

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.004
you're saving that video project as a file too.

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.007
So it's important to understand the basic concepts involved

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.007
in opening and saving files.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.009
For this example, I'll open up a built-in application

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.000
in Windows 10 called Notepad.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.003
I can find it by going to the Start menu,

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:39.009
scrolling down to Windows Accessories, and here is Notepad.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.003
And once I select that app,

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.006
it starts and opens a new blank document for me to type in.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.006
Now in some apps, to create a new document or other project,

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:49.007
you need to choose File, New.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.007
But in the case of Notepad,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.006
it automatically created a new document for me.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.004
And I'll just type a few words here.

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.007
Now anytime you're actively working

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.001
on a document or a project,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.007
it's a good practice to save your file periodically

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.005
so you don't lose your work should the electricity go out

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.004
or some other issue with your computer pops up.

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:11.002
To save what I've written so far, I'll choose File, Save.

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:12.001
That opens this window,

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.001
prompting me to choose a location on my computer to save it.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.006
Notice it's automatically selected My Documents folder,

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:19.008
but I can navigate to any other part of my computer,

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.006
for example, maybe I'll just save this on the desktop.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:23.009
I also should name the file.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.009
Right now it just has an asterisk in place of the file name,

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.000
but it also has this dot txt as part of the name.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.005
That txt is called a file extension.

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.001
The purpose of including a file extension

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.003
in the name of your file

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.006
is to identify what kind of file this is.

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.004
So if it needs to be opened by someone else,

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.000
their computer has a better chance of knowing

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.003
which application to use to open it.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:46.006
So plain text files like this one are dot txt files,

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.008
Microsoft Word files are dot doc,

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.002
Adobe Photoshop files or dot psd and so on.

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.004
For the most part, your computer will be able to open files

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:56.008
with hidden or missing extensions

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.003
with the right applications,

00:01:58.003 --> 00:01:59.005
but if you have to share this file

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.006
with someone running a different operating system,

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:04.005
their computer might not know what application to use.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.006
So I always leave the extension as part of the file name,

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.005
and I suggest you do too.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:13.000
So I'm going to save this on my desktop as story.txt.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.005
I'll click Save.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:15.009
And now my document is saved,

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.006
and you can see it sitting here on the desktop.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.000
Now I'm going to close Notepad.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.006
If I want to reopen that file,

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:24.004
the fastest way to do so in this instance

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:25.006
is to double click it

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:28.009
since it's sitting here in plain view on my desktop.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.002
Now if Notepad is already open,

00:02:30.002 --> 00:02:31.006
and I want to open a different document

00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:32.008
I previously worked on,

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.003
I could choose File, Open,

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:36.006
which lets me browse for my file

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.007
wherever it is on my computer.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.007
Many applications also have a file open recent command,

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:42.005
which gives you a list

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:44.000
of your most recently opened documents

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.009
so you have quick access to them.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.008
Notepad being a very basic text editor

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:49.004
doesn't have this option.

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:51.007
But there's a slightly more powerful built-in word processor

00:02:51.007 --> 00:02:54.001
called WordPad in accessories.

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:59.001
Again, I'll go to the Start menu, to Windows Accessories,

00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:01.005
and here I'll locate WordPad.

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:02.008
Now, WordPad's File menu

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:04.002
looks a little different than Notepad's,

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:05.009
but you get the same options.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:10.005
When I click File, you can see New, Save and Open.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.003
We also have a Recent documents area,

00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.000
which we can see over here to the right.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.001
And that shows me the documents

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:16.008
I've most recently worked with in WordPad,

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.003
and I can select them here to open them up again.

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:20.008
And you'll find that most other applications

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:21.008
also offer the ability

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:24.005
to open recently used documents and files.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:25.007
All right, so those are the basic things

00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:28.004
you should understand about opening and saving files.

00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:29.002
What I've shown you here

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.005
applies to almost every application out there.

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:32.008
You will find some applications

00:03:32.008 --> 00:03:34.009
that save your files or data automatically

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.003
and don't even offer a save command

00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:37.008
so you can do it yourself,

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:39.000
but those are much more rare,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.004
and you should still get into the habit

00:03:40.004 --> 00:03:43.000
of saving your files regularly while working on them.
