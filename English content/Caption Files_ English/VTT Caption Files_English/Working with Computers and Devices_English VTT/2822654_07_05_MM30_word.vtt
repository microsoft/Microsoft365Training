00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] In addition to using Word

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.009
on your desktop or laptop computer,

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.008
you can also install the mobile version of Word

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:09.002
on your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.001
This gives you the ability to access and edit your documents

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.001
and stay productive from virtually anywhere.

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.005
Just go to the app store on your mobile device.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.006
If you're on an Apple iPhone or iPad,

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.008
you'll open up the app store app.

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:23.002
If you're using an Android device,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.004
open the Google Play store app.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.007
Then do a search for Word,

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.003
select it, and from here, you can download

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.002
and install it on your device for free.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.006
So here you see Word on my iPad.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.003
Be aware that Word may look a little different

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.000
depending on the device you're using,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.008
but the functionality is nearly identical

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.003
across all mobile devices.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.007
For a specific details, you can visit support.office.com

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.009
in your web browser, and search for your device

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.000
by typing something like Word for iPad,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.003
and you'll see a list of results.

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.002
So to use Word on your mobile device,

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.004
signing with the same account

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.008
you use for Office on your desktop or laptop computer.

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.000
Be aware that to access basic features of Word,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.009
you don't need an Office subscription,

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.001
but a subscription doesn't lock all of the editing features

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.003
of Word on your mobile device.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.006
And once I'm signed in, I can use Word anytime.

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:13.003
I need to start a new document,

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.007
or work on an existing one without having to wait

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.008
to get back to my computer at home or at the office,

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:19.007
I'll create a new document

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.004
by clicking the blank document template.

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.004
And now I can start typing.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.009
Now, in this case, I'm typing with the onscreen keyboard,

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.002
but if you have an external keyboard

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.006
connected to your mobile device,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.007
you can use that to allow for more visible area

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:34.006
for your document on screen.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.007
You can then format the text

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.001
just like you can in the desktop version of Word.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.006
For instance, I could select this heading,

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:44.000
and then go to the styles menu, and apply heading one.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.003
Now you can see the top of the screen.

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:48.001
My document currently has the default name of document.

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:49.006
I want to give it a more descriptive name

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.009
so I know what this document contains later.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.000
So I'd have the file icon here

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.004
in the upper left hand corner and tap save.

00:01:56.004 --> 00:02:00.001
And I'll rename this to give any more descriptive name.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.000
This is also where I can choose the location

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.006
to save the file. If I want to be able to access it later

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.004
from another device or a computer,

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.000
I could save it to my OneDrive account online.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.002
Or alternately, if you know you won't have wifi

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.003
or internet access available as you're working,

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.000
you can save the file to your device instead of OneDrive,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.008
so you can continue working on it while you're not online.

00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:20.003
You can always save it to OneDrive later,

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:21.004
or to another location

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.006
once you've connected to the internet again.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.005
In this case, I'll just choose to save it on my iPad,

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.003
and I'll tap save.

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.008
And now I can continue working on my document.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:33.006
As you work, Word saves your changes automatically,

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.004
so you don't have to worry about remembering to save

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:39.001
as frequently as you may have to using the desktop version.

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.008
So with the mobile version of Word,

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.004
you have the freedom to work anywhere

00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:44.002
and capture your ideas in writing.
