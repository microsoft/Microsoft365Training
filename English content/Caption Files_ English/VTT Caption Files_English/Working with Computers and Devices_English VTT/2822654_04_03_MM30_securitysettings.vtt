00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Modern desktop operating systems

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.005
have built-in features to help protect your computer

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.004
from being compromised by problems like viruses and hackers.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.005
There's always more you can do

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.005
to ensure the security of your data,

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:12.007
but at the bare minimum,

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.006
you should check that the basic security features

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.006
of your computer are enabled.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.002
For example, here in Windows 10,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.009
we can go to our System Control Panel

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.000
by typing control panel in the Cortana search field,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.009
selecting it here.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.008
And from here we can select System and Security.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.002
Here you'll find Windows Defender Firewall,

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.003
which is a built-in service

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.005
that helps protect your computer

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.006
from unauthorized access over your network

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.001
and over the Internet.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.004
It can defend against malicious software and hackers

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.001
that may attempt to gain access to your computer.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.003
Windows Defender should be enabled by default,

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.002
but it's a good idea to make sure.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.007
Click its name

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.005
and then click Turn Windows Defender firewall on or off.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.004
Make sure Turn on Windows Defender Firewall

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:53.009
is enabled under both the private

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.000
and public network settings areas.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.008
And also make sure that both instances

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.009
have Notify me when Windows Defender Firewall

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.000
blocks a new app are checked.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.002
This will have your system alert you

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.008
if any application tries to gain access to your computer,

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.007
so you can determine whether to allow it that access.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.001
Now, Windows 10 also includes built-in antivirus features.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.005
You can check and configure its settings

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:17.004
by going to the Start Menu, to Settings,

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:20.004
and then Update and Security.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.008
Here, select Windows Security,

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:25.006
and click Virus and threat protection.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:28.005
By default, Windows periodically scans for viruses.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.006
But if you suspect your system

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.004
may have been compromised by a virus,

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.008
you can click on Scan Options

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.005
to choose the level of scan you want to perform.

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:39.009
And then click Scan Now to have Windows check for viruses.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.001
Again, both Windows Defender

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.000
and Windows antivirus features are enabled by default,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.002
but it's still a good idea to check your own computer

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:48.003
to make sure they're enabled and running.
