00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] One of the advantages of using

00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.008
a suite of applications that are designed to work together

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.006
is that you'll find similar features and layouts

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.000
within them, making it easier to get your bearings

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.007
and to find the features you want to use.

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.009
For example, in the office suite of applications,

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.001
which includes programs like Microsoft Word, Excel,

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.002
and PowerPoint, all of which I have opened here,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:21.008
you can see how similar they look,

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.001
especially in this area have tabs at the top of each window

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.004
called the ribbon.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.005
Notice that at least the first three tabs in each app

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:28.007
are labeled the same.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:31.000
We have file, home and insert.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.007
Both Word and PowerPoint have the Design tab next,

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.006
but the layout and the way the ribbon works in each app

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:36.009
is very similar.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.009
I'll expand Word for a moment here.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.004
Each tab gives you access to lots of tools and features.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.009
Under the Home tab in Word,

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.005
you'll find the cut copy and paste commands,

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.007
as well as the tools for changing the font size

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.005
or color of text.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.003
And we'll find those same options in PowerPoint and Excel.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:54.009
Here's cut, copy and paste.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.005
And here's where we can change the font,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.005
the color and size of text.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:00.001
So again, if you know where these features are

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.004
in one Office app, you'll be able to easily find them

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:03.009
in other Office apps.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.008
Now, of course, because these are three different apps

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.006
with different purposes, you'll find other specialized tools

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:11.008
and features under the other tabs specific to those apps.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.009
But they're all organized logically into the tab categories.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.009
For example, in Excel, there's a Formulas tab,

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.005
where you can apply functions to your spreadsheets

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.007
to automatically calculate the values in certain fields,

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:26.008
or in PowerPoint, there's an Animations tab

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.003
to apply animated transitions

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.004
between the slides in your presentations.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.003
Another consistent feature of the ribbon across

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:35.007
the Office applications is the ability to collapse it.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.007
Just double click any tab to collapse the ribbon.

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.004
And that frees up more space to work with your documents.

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:44.002
Click any tab to temporarily reveal its contents.

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:46.008
And when you click away, it will collapse again.

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:50.006
To bring the ribbon back, just double click any tab again.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.003
So once more when working in Office,

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:53.009
you should be able to find your way around

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.006
and locate the tools and features you need

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:56.009
by exploring the ribbon.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.000
And as you get more familiar with its layout,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.004
you'll be able to work more efficiently

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.000
in other Office apps as well.
