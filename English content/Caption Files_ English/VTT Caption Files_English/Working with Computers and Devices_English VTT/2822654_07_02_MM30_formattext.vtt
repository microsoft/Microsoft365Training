00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Instructor] Once you have some text

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:02.006
in your Word document,

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.000
you can start formatting the text

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.007
to adjust how it appears on the page

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:09.004
in terms of its size, color, font face, and so on.

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.000
When it comes to formatting text,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.001
all word processors follow the universal rule that the item

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.006
you want to format must be selected in order to be changed.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.009
Selecting text usually means taking your mouse cursor

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.009
and dragging across the text you want to effect.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.003
A quick way to select a single word

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.006
in your document is to double-click it.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.009
But in this case, I want to select this entire heading.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.001
So I'll just click and drag through it.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.009
So selecting tells the word processor that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.002
you want to effect only the text you've selected.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.005
After you've selected your text,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.003
you'll find your formatting tools.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.000
Here in Word, we see formatting tools under the home tab.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.006
So with my text selected, I'll come up to the toolbar.

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.009
I'll click the B button, which makes my text bold.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.005
We also have other buttons for formatting here,

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.000
like I for italicizing text and U for underlining.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.001
This is also where you'll find the menus

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.007
to change the font of your selected text, like so.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.001
A useful shortcut in Word is the format painter,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.008
which lets you apply the same formatting to other text.

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.007
So in this case, I made this heading bold,

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.004
and I changed its font.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:07.009
With it still selected, I'm going to come up

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.009
to the home tab again and find the format painter.

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.004
I'll click, and then I'll select the second heading

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.005
with the format painter tool.

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:16.003
And just like that,

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.006
the same properties are applied to this text.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.003
I can do it again by clicking format painter one more time

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:23.007
and selecting this third heading.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:24.009
And there it is.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.007
But again, the key to formatting text

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.000
in Word and all word processing applications

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is to first select the text you want to change,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.003
and then make your changes.
