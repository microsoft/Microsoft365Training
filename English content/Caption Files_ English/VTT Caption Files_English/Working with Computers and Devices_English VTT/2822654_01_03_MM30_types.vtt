00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.009
- As you know, computers come in many different forms

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.001
from desktop computers to laptops,

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.004
to tablets and mobile phones.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.007
These are sometimes referred to as personal computers

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.008
to distinguish them from other types of computers,

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.006
like calculators, smart TVs, or gaming consoles,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.001
which are all technically computers too.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:21.009
Let's take a moment here to look at the different

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.002
characteristics of the most common types of personal

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.007
computers and the types of uses that are best suited for,

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:31.001
a desktop computer is a computer that's designed to stay

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.004
in one place, like your office work area

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.008
or some other semi-permanent location

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.006
in your home or office.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.005
Desktop computers are typically comprised of separate pieces

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.005
for the base unit, the monitor, the keyboard,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.003
mouse and speakers.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.002
These separate pieces, as well as the fact

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.000
that desktop computers have to be plugged

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.006
into an electrical outlet,

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:52.008
make them impractical for moving them

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.008
from location to location.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.008
Laptop computers, on the other hand are computers

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:00.005
that are designed to be portable and all the necessary parts

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.004
to use the computer from the monitor, to the speakers,

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.005
to the keyboard and track pad mouse

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.008
are all contained in one device.

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.001
Laptops are also battery powered,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.007
so you don't have to keep them plugged into an

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.001
outlet to use them.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.004
Making them ideal for using in different areas

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.000
of your home or on the road.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.009
Now, tablet computers are another type of portable computer,

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.009
usually even smaller and lighter than laptops.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.000
Instead of having a physical keyboard and track pad,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.006
tablets are touch sensitive,

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:32.000
meaning you tap and interact directly with the items

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.007
on the screen with your fingers,

00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.003
or sometimes with a special pen called a stylus.

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:38.009
And when you need to input text,

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.006
a screen-based keyboard will appear.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.004
Like desktop and laptop computers,

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:46.003
you can install software applications on tablets for work,

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.000
but they're lightweight and size also makes

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.003
them ideal for entertainment like for reading

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.001
electronic books or watching movies.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.003
And lastly, smartphones are another type

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.005
of common personal computing device.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.009
That's small enough to be held in one hand.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.005
Like the other devices we've looked at,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.003
you can install software on smartphones

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:06.006
to accomplish all sorts of tasks.

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.006
Although their size generally doesn't make them ideal

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:10.006
for complicated work.

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:12.007
Now, smartphones connect to mobile networks

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.002
to let you make phone calls,

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.001
but this connection also gives you access to the internet,

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.007
making it possible to communicate with others,

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:22.004
access your email, share files,

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:25.001
and perform a variety of other online tasks that other

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:28.001
personal computers typically require a wifi internet

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.000
connection to accomplish.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.007
So depending on your needs,

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.005
you may find yourself using one or a combination of these

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:37.003
types of personal computing devices to get things done.
