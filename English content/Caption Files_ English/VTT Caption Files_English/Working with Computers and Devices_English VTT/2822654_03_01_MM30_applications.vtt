00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.006
- Applications are the programs that your computer runs

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.003
and in which you'll spend most of your time

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.008
on your computer.

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.002
Generally, an application is any piece of software

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.000
used to accomplish a task,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
whether that task is writing a paper,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
composing music, editing a digital photo,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.002
playing a video game, browsing the web,

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:19.008
or checking your email.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.009
There are countless applications for countless purposes.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.004
Some applications come pre-installed on your computer,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.002
like the web browser, Microsoft Edge,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.008
and the basic word processor, Word Pad.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.005
And you can acquire and use other apps

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.009
by downloading and installing them

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.006
from software company's websites,

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:37.002
or through services like the Microsoft Store.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.004
The same goes for the apps you use on mobile devices,

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.006
like your phone.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.003
Often mobile apps are specialized for use on the go,

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.006
like navigation apps that help you find directions

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:46.009
to different locations,

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.004
or time management apps that send you notifications

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.000
reminding you of meetings and appointments.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You can get almost any kind of app on your mobile device.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
For the most part, mobile apps are simpler and less powerful

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.001
than desktop apps,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.005
which are apps designed to run on desktop computers,

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:03.004
as well as laptop computers.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.004
Desktops and laptops are more powerful than mobile devices

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.004
and offer more screen space to work.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:09.009
So they're more suited for running apps

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.004
with more features and complexity.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.009
However, you'll find that app developers make both desktop

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.007
and mobile versions of their applications

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.007
and they often work well together.

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.005
For example, you could start drafting a document

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:21.009
in Microsoft Word on your phone

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.004
while you're commuting on a train

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:24.008
and then continue working on it

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:28.000
from the desktop version of word when you arrive home.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.001
These days with so many apps available,

00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:31.002
you can find lots of apps

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.005
for both desktop and mobile devices

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.001
that are designed to help you accomplish specific tasks

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.000
and get work done.
