00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.005
- If you share a computer with others,

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.005
it's a good idea for each user to have their own account.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.001
Everyone having their own account

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.001
is better for security reasons.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.003
For instance no one can access anyone else's account

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:12.007
without their password.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.002
But it's also good for personal organization

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.006
of everyone's files.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.002
Meaning your files won't be mixed in

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:20.001
with everyone else's files.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.003
All modern operating systems with the exception

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:23.009
of some mobile operating systems,

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.000
allow you to create individual accounts

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.006
for each separate user of that computer.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:31.000
In Windows 10, for example,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.003
you can create new user accounts

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:36.003
by going to the start menu, opening settings,

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.005
going to accounts, and selecting family and other users.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.002
And from here, you can add a family member if for instance,

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.008
you want to add an account for a kid that you can monitor,

00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.002
or you can choose add someone else to this PC

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.002
to create an individual user account for someone

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.001
who's not part of your family.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:53.004
I'll just close that for now.

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:55.008
So again the point of having individual accounts

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:58.006
is that each account on the computer is password protected

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.004
so only the individual user can access to that account,

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:02.009
which in turn provides more security

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.006
for everyone else's files.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.008
Each user has their own user folder on the computer.

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.001
Let's see how to get to that user folder

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.001
so we can take a closer look at it.

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:12.002
Now there are faster ways to get

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.002
to some of the folders inside your user folder

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.005
than what I'm about to show you.

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.001
But I also want you to see exactly

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.007
where this folder is located. So bear with me.

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:20.009
Currently I don't have any windows

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.008
or any applications running.

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.001
I'm going to open up File Explorer

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.009
by clicking this icon here in the task bar.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.005
And then in the left sidebar of the window

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:33.005
that opens under this PC, I'm going to select local disc.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.003
This local disc labeled the C drive

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.004
is my main or startup hard drive containing

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.009
the operating system and other important folders.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.007
Now most of these folders you see here

00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:43.005
are for the windows operating systems use,

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.003
and you generally don't want to mess around in them

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:46.009
unless you know what you're doing.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.003
But this is also where you'll find the user's folder.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:50.009
I'll double click it to open it.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.007
In the user's folder,

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.007
you'll find a folder for each account on your computer

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.000
with the user's name on it,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or whatever the name of the account is.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.004
To view the contents of your user folder, double click it.

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:03.001
So again your user folder is your folder.

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:05.000
It's where you can store all of your documents,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.008
music, photos, videos, and so on.

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.001
Now you can store files in other parts of your hard drive,

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:12.005
but there are very few reasons to do that.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.003
It's best to keep all of your personal files here

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:17.008
in your user folder so they're all in one central location.

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:19.006
You're also free to create additional folders

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.002
in your user folder or within any of these default folders

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:24.000
as your needs require.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.004
Anytime you're using an application

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:27.004
and you want to save a file, for example,

00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.004
if you're writing a paper and you want to save it,

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.003
you should navigate to your documents folder,

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.001
or into a folder you have nested inside

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.004
the documents folder.

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:36.009
If you're saving photos, save them to your pictures folder.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.000
And so on.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.004
This keeps everything organized

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.000
and in one central location

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.007
for each individual user on the computer.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.005
Notice you can quickly access these folders

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.002
from the left sidebar as well.

00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:51.003
I can click on documents to get to my documents folder,

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:54.000
or music to get to my music folder.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.002
To set up a faster way to get to your user folder,

00:02:56.002 --> 00:02:59.009
you can click the start menu to go back to settings.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:04.003
Here's like the personalization, and choose start.

00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.001
Then click choose which folders appear on start.

00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:08.009
From here you can choose which of your personal folders

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.005
will show up in the start menu.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:13.001
So if you often need to open the document folder,

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.007
you can make sure documents is enabled here.

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:18.002
But I actually prefer to enable the personal folder,

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.008
which is another name for your user folder.

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:25.003
So if I close this now, when I click the start menu,

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:27.007
notice we can now find personal folder.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.007
And that way I can get to all of my folders quickly

00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:32.004
without cluttering up my start menu too much.

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:34.004
So that's your user folder in Windows.

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.007
Again I highly recommend that you store and organize

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:39.007
all of your personal files and other media in this location.
