00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- These days the term computer can refer

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.008
to many different types of devices.

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.003
We have desktop computers, laptop or notebook computers

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.005
and mobile devices like tablets and phones

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.004
are even considered computers.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.006
At the most basic level, a computer is an electronic device

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.000
that you use to create, process, store, or retrieve

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.004
different types of data and information.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.007
For example, you might create a word processing document

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.004
on a desktop computer or browse the internet

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.003
on a tablet device, or email photos from your mobile phone.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.004
All computers consist of two main parts,

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.004
hardware and software.

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.003
Software refers to the programs that run on the computer.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.007
Basically software programs are the parts of the computer

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.002
you can't physically touch,

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.004
like a word processing application, an email program

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:47.008
and even the computer's operating system is software.

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.009
Most computers come with built in software

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.000
and you can install a virtually unlimited number

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.001
of other software programs that you might want

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.003
or need to use on your computer.

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.005
Now, hardware refers to all the physical parts

00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.009
that make up a computer.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.008
For example, on a desktop computer,

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.000
you have the main unit that contains the central parts

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.001
like the CPU, the RAM or memory, and the hard drive.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.009
With desktop computers, you also need an external monitor,

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.002
also called a display and devices for inputting information

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.004
like a keyboard and a mouse.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.005
On computers like laptops, tablets, or mobile devices,

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.006
the display is built into the device

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:24.000
and they all generally have built in keyboards

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
or, as is the case with many tablets and mobile devices,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.009
the keyboard appears on screen when needed.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.000
Computer hardware can also refer to any number

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.001
of accessories you can connect to the computer

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.001
such as printers, scanners, speakers, and so on,

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.009
which give additional functionality to the computer.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.004
So again, when we talk about computers

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:42.009
at the most basic level,

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.002
we're talking about an electronic machine comprised of

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.007
various pieces of hardware

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.003
on which you can operate various pieces of software.
