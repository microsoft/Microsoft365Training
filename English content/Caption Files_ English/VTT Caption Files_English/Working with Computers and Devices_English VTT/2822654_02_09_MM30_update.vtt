00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Narrator] An important part of making sure your computer

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.007
and its programs continue to run smoothly

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.002
is to periodically check for and install updates

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.009
to your operating system.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.004
For example, both Microsoft and Apple

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.002
frequently release updates to their Windows

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.000
and Mac OS operating systems,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.003
often fixing bugs and adding new features.

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:20.000
To check for updates in Windows 10,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.005
go to the start menu,

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:27.007
to settings, and select update and security.

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.006
Make sure Windows update is selected

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.000
and then click check for updates.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.007
As long as you're connected to the internet,

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:37.005
Windows will check for system and security-related updates.

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:38.006
If any updates are available,

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.006
you'll see the progress of them being downloaded

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.004
and you'll have the option to install them,

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.005
which often involves restarting your computer.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:45.007
So it's a good idea to make sure you're not working

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.008
in other applications or on any projects

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.009
when you're checking for and installing updates.

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.002
You can see I currently see this message

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:53.006
saying that I'm up to date,

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.008
meaning there are no system or security updates available,

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.006
but notice there is a feature update available

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.001
to my version of Windows 10.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.004
And if I'm ready to install that,

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:06.002
I can click download and install now to begin that process.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.008
And you can see now we'll go through the process

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.008
of updating Windows.

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:11.008
But again, if you don't see any available updates,

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.002
it means your computer is already up to date.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.003
But you can still check back here periodically

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.006
to see if any updates have been released.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.005
Again, it's a good idea to install updates

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:23.001
to make sure your computer continues to run smoothly.
