00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] An essential part in learning

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.003
to become proficient when it comes to using a computer

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.003
is to learn the right click.

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.003
The term right click refers to the button found

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:11.004
on the right side of a mouse with two or more buttons.

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.001
Generally, if you're right handed,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:14.005
you'll click the left button of the mouse

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.002
the majority of the time with your right index finger.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:18.006
This is the mouse's main button

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.004
that allows you to select items,

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.002
double click things, and make selections.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.005
But both the operating system,

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.002
and most applications you'll use have special shortcuts,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.002
and menus that will appear when you click items

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.003
with the right mouse button.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.003
For example, left clicking this file on my desktop,

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:35.001
lets me select it.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.000
But right clicking it opens up this menu.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.005
What do you see in right click menus

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.003
sometimes called contextual menus

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.003
depends on the item you're clicking.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.004
For this file I see options to open it,

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.003
to share it, or to delete it.

00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:52.003
So if I choose delete, that sends it to the recycle bin.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.006
I can double click the recycle bin

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.009
with my left mouse button to view its contents.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.003
And you can see I have three items in here.

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:00.006
Now, as we learned earlier,

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.003
items in the recycle bin can be moved back out

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:05.005
in case you didn't mean to delete them.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.005
One way is to drag them back into the folder they came from.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.000
But you can also right click the files in the recycle bin.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.002
And those one of the options here is restore.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.002
Selecting that sends the file back to the folder

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:17.001
it came from,

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.001
which is much faster than opening both the folder,

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.007
and the recycle bin and dragging the file

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.006
from one to the other.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.008
Right click options are often designed to save time.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.005
For example, if you want to permanently delete

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.004
the items in the recycle bin, you could open it up,

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.008
click the recycle bin tools tab,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.006
and from here choose to empty the recycle bin.

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.002
But another and faster way to do this,

00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.005
is to right click the recycle bin,

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.004
and choose empty recycle bin.

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.007
This way you don't even have to open up

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.001
the recycle bin first, which can again save time

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.005
if you're certainly you want to empty it

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.002
before checking its contents.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:51.008
Here, I'll click yes.

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.003
And now my recycle bin is empty.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.000
The point is that you should get in the habit

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.003
of trying to right click items

00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.004
just to see what shortcuts software designers

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:00.008
may have hidden.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:04.000
Oftentimes you'll find shortcuts to commands and actions

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.006
that may otherwise involve navigating

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:08.005
through several menus or dialog boxes.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:10.002
Now incidentally if you're left handed and need

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.007
to switch the actions of the left and right mouse buttons,

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:17.000
you can right click on the desktop and choose personalize.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.007
That takes you to the personalization area

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.006
of your system settings.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:23.004
Click the home icon to go to the main settings window,

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:26.001
and then click devices.

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:29.001
And here I'll select mouse.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.004
You can switch between your left and right mouse buttons

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.000
as your primary button.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.009
So if you're left handed,

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.009
you'll set the right button as the main mouse button,

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.003
and the left button then becomes the button

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:40.003
for revealing special menus.

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:41.004
Again, right-clicking items

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.002
is an important concept to learn.

00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:45.005
Just take some time when working in various applications

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:46.007
to right click a few things,

00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:48.009
and see what options may be available.

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.007
More often than not you'll find and learn

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.004
some great time-saving shortcuts.
