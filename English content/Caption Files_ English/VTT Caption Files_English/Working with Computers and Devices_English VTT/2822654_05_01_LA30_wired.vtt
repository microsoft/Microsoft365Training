00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.002
- Let's take a look at how to connect your computer

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.004
to your network via a wired Ethernet connection.

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.009
Now, this assumes that your network has already been set up

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.006
in your home, office, or classroom.

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.004
If you're connecting to your home network,

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:15.002
you're most likely going to run an Ethernet cable

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.000
from your computer directly into your router.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.001
If you're connecting in an office or classroom environment,

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.002
chances are you'll be running an Ethernet cable

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:26.002
from your computer into an Ethernet port on the wall

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.005
or some other fixture,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.000
which in turn connects to your network.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.006
In any case, the important thing is

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.007
that you have a cable running from whatever the source

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.001
of your network connection is

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.006
into the Ethernet port on your computer.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.006
Nearly all desktop computers have built-in Ethernet ports,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.000
though you're not seeing them as much on laptops these days,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.005
as in the past.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.004
If your laptop doesn't have Ethernet

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.002
or if you're using a tablet or a mobile phone,

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.000
you'll connect wirelessly to your network,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.009
which we'll look at how to do later.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.005
This case, though, I'll just plug the cable

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.009
that's running from my desktop's Ethernet port

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.008
right into my router.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.006
And once you have your computer connected

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.001
to your network via Ethernet,

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.001
chances are you're already on your network

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.006
and you're so-called setup is done.

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.007
In most cases, once you connect your computer

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:11.007
to your network with an Ethernet cable,

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.007
you'll automatically be connected to the network and be able

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.009
to communicate with other computers on the network,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.005
as well as access the internet.
