00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.005
- You've probably heard the term operating system before,

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.007
but you might not be exactly sure what it means.

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.003
- Essentially, your computer's operating system

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.005
is the software that manages how you interact

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.006
with the computer, how the programs on the computer

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.002
use and access the computer's hardware,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.006
and is a big part of how your computer behaves and performs.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.002
You can think of the operating system as the master program

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.006
that runs and manages all the other programs

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.004
on your computer.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.009
It's the backbone of your computer

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.002
and the most important program, because it controls

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.005
everything that goes in and out

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.001
of your computer, from allocating memory to programs,

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.006
to copying files from one drive to another,

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.000
to receiving commands from your keyboard and mouse,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.006
to telling you the time of day.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.001
You can't have a computer without an operating system.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.006
Usually the operating system comes pre-installed

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.004
on your computer, but if you've had your computer

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.008
for a few years, you may want or need to upgrade

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.001
your operating system to the most current version

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.005
that the operating systems manufacturer has released.

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:56.003
Now, with that said,

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.005
there are many different operating systems out there.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.005
On PCs, the most popular operating system is Windows.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:04.006
On Mac's the operating system is called macOS.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:05.007
These are probably the two

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.000
most well known operating systems.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.003
You may have also heard of Linux,

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.008
another popular computer operating system.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.008
And generally, any computer or device that runs programs,

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:18.001
especially multiple programs has an operating system.

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.005
Your mobile phone runs an operating system.

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:23.003
For example, Android devices run Android OS,

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:26.007
and the Apple mobile device operating system is iOS.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.004
Now, in addition to the essential purpose

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.006
of managing your computer and the programs you use,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.009
most operating systems like Windows and macOS

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.005
also come with built-in programs called applications.

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:41.001
Applications are also called apps, programs or software.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.000
These can be simple word processing applications,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
applications for managing your photos,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.006
applications for sending and receiving emails, and so on.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.007
In some cases, you can get by with the applications included

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:53.005
with your operating system.

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.004
For example, both Windows and macOS come with built-in

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.000
web browsing applications for browsing the web,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.002
but you're also free to install and use applications

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:02.009
made by other companies.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.008
Some applications can be downloaded for free

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.002
from the companies that make them.

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.008
Others have to be purchased.

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.003
It really depends on what application we're talking about.

00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:11.009
It's also very important to note

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.006
that you usually have to make sure you're downloading

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.002
or purchasing the version of software

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.002
that's made for your operating system.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.008
For example, if you're using Windows,

00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:20.008
you need to run Windows applications.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.006
If you're on a Mac, you need Mac applications.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.009
In many cases, software developers release both versions

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.004
of their software, but there are many applications

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.006
that only work with one or the other.

00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:33.000
Whether you're downloading software

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.002
or purchasing at a store, you should always be able to find

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:38.003
a section called system requirements that will let you know

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:40.007
what operating system you need to run the software,

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.007
as well as the minimum amount of RAM, hard drive space,

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.002
and any other requirements.
