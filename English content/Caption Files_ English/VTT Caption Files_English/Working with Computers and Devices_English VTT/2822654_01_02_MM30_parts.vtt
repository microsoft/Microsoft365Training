00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.009
- When we use the term computer,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.008
we're usually referring to a collection

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.004
of various hardware components

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.007
that make up the computer as a whole.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.009
Even though there are many types

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.007
of computers available today,

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.006
they're all comprised of a similar set

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.006
of primary hardware parts, like the base unit,

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:21.001
the monitor, the keyboard, the mouse, and speakers.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.003
What we refer to as the base unit

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.006
contains all the hardware components that are necessary

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:27.006
for the computer to function.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.007
For example, this is where you'll find the hard drive,

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:32.000
which is your computer's storage device.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.004
Kind of like the filing cabinet

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.004
where everything on your computer is stored,

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.008
from programs, to documents, to videos.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.008
Basically anything that's stored on your computer

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.001
is stored on the hard drive.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:46.005
You'll also find the RAM or memory in the base unit.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.009
Think of your computer's RAM as the desk in your office.

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.007
In order to work with the files from my filing cabinet,

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.000
I need to have space on my desk

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.006
to pile and organize my files.

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.006
The smaller the desk, the fewer the files

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.002
and other items I can work with at a time.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.004
Similarly, the less RAM you have,

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.003
the fewer documents and applications

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.009
it can have running at once on your computer.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.009
That's why RAM is one of the most common upgrades

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.006
people have done to their computers.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.009
Also found the base unit is the CPU,

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.000
or central processing unit.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.008
The CPU is the computer's brain.

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.009
And it's the item that carries out all the functions

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.003
of the computer, from processing instructions

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:25.006
from the programs you're running

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:28.002
to keeping the operating system working.

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.008
The base unit is also where you'll find the various ports

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:32.005
that allow you to connect additional hardware

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.006
to your computer, like printers,

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.008
external hard drives, and so on.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.006
For some computers, the base unit is a separate component.

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.006
While on devices like laptop or tablet computers,

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.009
all the items I mentioned, like the hard drive,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.002
the memory, and so on are built into the computer.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.003
Similarly on laptops and tablets,

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.005
the monitor is built into the computer,

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.004
while with other computers, the monitor is a separate device

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:59.000
that you connect to the base unit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The monitor, sometimes referred to as the display,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.002
is what allows you to see what's being displayed

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.003
by the computer, whatever that may be,

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:10.006
from text documents, to videos, to photos.

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:13.000
But to actually interact with and use a computer,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.002
you need a keyboard and a mouse.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.006
The keyboard lets you input text, numbers,

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:20.004
and other characters into the applications you're using.

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.004
And the mouse is a pointing device

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:24.005
that allows you to operate the computer

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:26.004
by pointing at and interacting with

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.007
the elements that are on the screen.

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.001
Again, on some computers,

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.001
the keyboard and the mouse are separate devices

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.001
that you need to connect to the base unit's ports

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.008
in order to use them.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.001
On laptops, the keyboard is built in.

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.004
And most laptops generally use a pointing device

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:41.007
called a track pad

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.003
for moving the mouse cursor on the screen.

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:47.001
On tablet devices, you generally don't use a mouse,

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.005
but instead tap or slide your finger on the screen

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:51.002
to interact with the device.

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.001
And the keyboard is often virtual.

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.003
Meaning it appears on screen

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.008
when you need to input text or other characters.

00:02:57.008 --> 00:02:59.001
Other important hardware components

00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:00.006
that make up computers these days

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.004
include speakers, which allow you to hear audio

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:04.007
from the apps you're using.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.001
This could be music,

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.007
or the soundtrack from a video you're watching,

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.001
or what people are saying in a video conference.

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:12.008
Without speakers, you won't be able to hear

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:15.000
the sounds your computer is making.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.002
And similarly, you'll need a microphone

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:20.000
if you want to be able to be heard through your computer,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.008
whether it's in a video conferencing app

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:25.003
or other program where you may need to record your voice.

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:26.007
Again, laptops and tablets

00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:29.001
usually have speakers and microphones built in,

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:30.006
while other computers require you

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.008
to connect external speakers and microphones.

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.000
Now of course, there's a lot more

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.005
that can make up a computer.

00:03:36.005 --> 00:03:38.001
But the components we covered here,

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:41.003
the base unit, the monitor, the keyboard and mouse,

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:44.002
and speakers and microphone, are the most essential parts

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:46.004
needed to interact with and operate

00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:49.001
most of the apps you'll commonly use on your computer.
