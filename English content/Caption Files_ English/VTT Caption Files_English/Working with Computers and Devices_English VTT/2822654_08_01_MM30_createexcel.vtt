00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.007
- The first step to working with spreadsheets

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.008
in Microsoft Excel is to open an existing workbook

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.007
or to create a brand new one.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.005
You can start from scratch with a completely blank workbook

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.002
or use one of the many available templates

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.004
included with Office to create workbooks

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:18.004
for making calendars, managing budgets, generating invoices,

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.009
and lots more.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.007
To create a new workbook, open Excel.

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:24.005
And with the Home tab selected,

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.001
you can click Blank workbook

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.000
to instantly create a new empty spreadsheet

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.008
and start entering content into the cells right away.

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.000
Or to create a new workbook based on a template,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.008
from here, go to File,

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.006
and then select New.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.005
And below the blank workbook option,

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.009
you'll find a large collection of templates to choose from,

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.003
and you can scroll to browse through the templates.

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:46.005
Or you can scroll back up and type a search term

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.001
to look for online templates.

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.006
I'll search for budget.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:53.004
And you can see these are all budget related templates now.

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.008
Click any template to get a closer look

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.003
and to read a description.

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.001
And when you find a template you'd like to use,

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.002
click Create.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.008
Let's zoom out a little here so we can see the whole thing.

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.009
Now, the advantage of using a template like this

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.006
is that it already includes formulas

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:08.003
to perform these calculations.

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:09.004
You'll be able to see the numbers

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:14.004
and this Percentage bar updating as I make changes.

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:15.007
Once you started making changes

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.003
or adding content to your workbook,

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.006
you should save it so you don't lose those changes.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:23.006
One way to do this is to click File and then Save as.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.006
Then choose a location to save the file.

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.004
If you have a OneDrive account set up,

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:28.008
you can save to your OneDrive folder

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.004
to save your document to the cloud

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.002
so you'll be able to access it from anywhere

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.001
on any device running Excel.

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.003
Or you can choose to save it locally

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:38.005
to the computer you're currently using by choosing Browse.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.001
Navigate to the location on your computer

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:41.008
where you want to save your file.

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.004
My Documents folder is currently selected,

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.006
which is where I'll leave it.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:45.007
Then name your file.

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:48.003
I'll keep the current name of Monthly Food Budget

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.006
and I'll click Save.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.006
So it's now saved to my Documents folder,

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.008
and I can see that if I go to the Start menu

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.007
and select Documents to open up that folder

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.003
and there it is.

00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:00.001
So now I can continue working on my spreadsheet

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.000
here in Excel.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.003
As you work, it's a good idea to periodically save your file

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.005
to make sure you don't lose your changes.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.003
Once you've saved your file the first time,

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:10.007
you can quickly save it again by clicking the Save button

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:12.004
at the top of the Excel window.

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:15.002
So that's how to create and save a new workbook in Excel.
