00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] Another common feature

00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:03.007
found in the operating systems of modern devices

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.006
is a digital assistant.

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:07.007
You may have heard of Microsoft's Cortana,

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:11.000
Apple's Siri, or Google's Assistant.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.005
Virtual assistants use artificial intelligence, or AI,

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:15.007
to learn more about you

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.007
so they become more helpful the more you use them.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.004
Here let's take a look at Cortana,

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:24.002
the virtual assistant built into Microsoft Windows 10.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.001
You can interact with Cortana either through typing

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.008
on your computer's keyboard or by using your voice.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.009
Bear in mind that your computer needs to have a microphone

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.000
in order for you to use your voice with Cortana.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.004
To use Cortana by typing,

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.004
you just click in the search box in the task bar

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.002
and type a question.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.001
To you use your voice,

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.009
click the Talk to Cortana button next to the search box.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.004
Let's say, for example, that I need to remember

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.007
to step away from my computer at 5:00 tomorrow

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.002
to cook dinner.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.004
I'll click the Talk to Cortana button and say,

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:57.004
remind me to make dinner tomorrow at 5:00 p.m.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.004
- [Cortana] Okay, great.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.001
- [Instructor] And now when 5:00 p.m. arrives tomorrow,

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.007
Cortana will notify me with my reminder.

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.004
So that's just one example of what Cortana can do.

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.005
In addition to giving you time-based reminders,

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:12.008
Cortana can also track packages, give you sports scores,

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:16.007
track flights, send emails or texts, manage your calendar,

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.007
create and manage lists, and open any app on your system.

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.005
If you find yourself frequently using your voice

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.008
to interact with Cortana, you can apply a setting

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.000
so you don't have to click the Talk to Cortana button

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.002
in order to talk to Cortana.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:34.004
Go to the Start menu and open Settings and select Cortana.

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.006
And here you can enable the Hey Cortana setting.

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:38.007
Once you've enabled this,

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.005
you can talk to Cortana at any time

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:42.006
just by saying, hey Cortana.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.004
So I'll turn that on.

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.003
And I'll close Settings.

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:47.007
And let's try it.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.007
Hey Cortana, show me images of Basset Hounds.

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.004
- [Cortana] I pulled up some images for you.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.001
- [Instructor] And there we go.

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:57.009
I'll go ahead and close that.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.005
Or since I'm making dinner tonight,

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.001
I'll ask Cortana to look up a recipe for me.

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.002
Hey Cortana, find a recipe for ratatouille.

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.004
- [Cortana] The first recipe is ratatouille

00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:12.007
with 3.5 out of five stars on Martha Stewart.

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:13.005
- [Instructor] So as you can see,

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.005
Cortana searched the web and found me these recipes.

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.003
If any of them look good to me, I could click on them

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:20.006
to go to the webpage to get the recipe.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.001
Probably one of the best ways to learn

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.008
about Cortana's abilities is to ask it questions

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.002
or to try seeing if it can perform

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:28.000
different activities for you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.009
Or just say, hey Cortana, what can you help me do?

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.009
- [Cortana] Here's how I can help.

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:35.005
- [Instructor] And you'll get this list of useful commands

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.005
to try out to help you work more efficiently

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:38.005
and get things done.
