00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Every software application

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.002
has a learning curve.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.004
Some applications are easier to use and understand

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.003
than others,

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:07.003
but what you're going to find

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:10.001
as you become more experienced with computers and software,

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.001
is that nearly all applications have features

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.005
or controls in common with each other.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.005
If you're a novice with computers at the moment,

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.007
you've probably wondered how more experienced users

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:20.005
can just sit down and start being productive

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.002
with applications they've never used before.

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.001
What seasoned computer users know

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.008
is that most applications have basic things in common,

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.002
and they know where to look for the commands

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.009
that will allow them to perform the tasks

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.006
they want to accomplish.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.006
For example, a common feature found in many apps

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.002
is the File menu,

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.005
and it usually contains commands

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.009
like New, Open, Save, Close, and Print.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.000
New is for creating a new document, image,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.008
or project, depending on what app you're in.

00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.002
Open opens files or projects

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.000
that you've previously created or worked on.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.005
Save saves the file you're currently working on.

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.004
And if the application is one that you can print from

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.007
like a word processor, a spreadsheet program,

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:57.008
or a photo editor,

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.001
you'll always find the print command

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.009
under the File menu as well.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.008
Another common feature is a group of commands

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.007
found under the Edit menu.

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.005
This is where you'll almost always find the commands

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.003
for Cut, Copy, and Paste,

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.004
as well as the Undo and Redo options.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.009
So for example, if you've typed some texts

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:13.007
that you would like to copy

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.007
to another location in your document,

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.007
you would select the text

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.008
by clicking and dragging across it.

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:23.007
Then come up to the Edit menu and choose Copy,

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:24.008
and then you could place your cursor

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:25.007
elsewhere in the document

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:28.007
or in a completely different document

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.008
and choose Edit, Paste.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.007
And if you change your mind about pasting that text,

00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.007
you would return to the Edit menu and choose Undo.

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.004
And again, these commands work the same way

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:40.008
in any apps that have them.

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.008
And you'll almost always find them under the Edit menu.

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.001
Bear in mind that this holds true

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.000
across operating systems, too.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.006
So if you're a Mac user finding yourself

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:51.008
working with Windows or a Windows user having to use a Mac,

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:53.006
you won't be completely lost.

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.000
You'll most likely see differences

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.004
in how menus and commands have been laid out,

00:01:57.004 --> 00:01:59.008
but many of the ideas are the same.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.001
Even between applications on the same operating system

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.005
you'll see differences.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.002
For example, if I switch over to Microsoft Excel,

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.005
instead of a plain menu bar,

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.002
we have a collection of tabs known as the ribbon.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.000
Notice we have a File tab though, and if I click it,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.007
I can still find New, Open, Save, Print, and so on.

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.004
It looks different than it does in Notepad,

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.004
but the commands are the same.

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.008
Note however, that we don't see an edit tab.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.007
In this case, we have a Home tab,

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.004
and this is where we find buttons for Cut

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.003
and Copy and Paste.

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:29.008
And the buttons for Undo and Redo

00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.009
are here at the top of the window.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.001
So again, the layout is different,

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.007
but the behavior of the commands is the same.

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.002
You just may have to hunt around a bit for them.

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.001
Another feature that almost all apps have in common

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.007
are preference settings.

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:43.007
These are the settings that often let you customize

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.007
or change how the app behaves.

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:46.008
They may be called different things

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.004
depending on the app you're using.

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:51.000
Here in Excel if I go to the File tab,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.002
down at the bottom I'll find Options.

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.002
Which takes me to this large collection of settings

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:58.006
that I can use to adjust how Excel looks and works.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:02:59.005
In other apps,

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.002
for example, in the Microsoft Edge web browser,

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:04.004
we click this three dot menu,

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.006
which gives us access to some options,

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.005
but we can also select settings

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.000
to further customize how Edge operates.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.008
In other apps you'll find a preferences selection

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:14.002
under the Edit menu.

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:15.002
So you sometimes have to do

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:16.007
some hunting around in Windows apps,

00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:18.001
but those are generally where you'll find

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.009
application preferences.

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.008
Lastly, you'll find almost all applications

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:23.002
have a Help menu.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.006
The Help menu is where you'll find things

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.008
like the built-in or online instruction manual

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:28.007
for the application you're using.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.005
You might also find links to tutorials

00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:31.008
or other special guides

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.003
to teach you how to use the application.

00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:37.002
The Help menu is also where you can often check for updates,

00:03:37.002 --> 00:03:39.001
which has the application check online

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:41.000
to see if any newer versions of the software

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.004
have been released.

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.008
Here in Edge we come up to the three dot menu again,

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.002
and this is where we can find Help and Feedback.

00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:48.005
And if I choose Help,

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:51.001
that takes me to the Edge support website.

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.002
Back here in Excel, there's a Help tab,

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:56.006
and that gives you buttons for contacting support,

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.001
showing training documents,

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.009
or you can click the Help button

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.001
to see instructions for using Excel.

00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:03.009
But generally the help menu is a good place to go

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:04.008
if you can't figure out

00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:06.008
a feature of the application you're using,

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:09.005
or just want to learn more about the application overall.

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:11.000
And again, you'll find that most applications

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.005
have this menu.

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:14.003
So those are just some of the common features

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.006
you'll find in nearly all applications.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:18.003
As you continue to work in various apps,

00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:19.009
you'll notice many more.

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.001
And knowing about these features

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:23.007
can really help make an application you've never used before

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:25.000
a little less daunting,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.008
because at least you'll already be familiar with

00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:29.001
and know how to use a couple of the commands.
