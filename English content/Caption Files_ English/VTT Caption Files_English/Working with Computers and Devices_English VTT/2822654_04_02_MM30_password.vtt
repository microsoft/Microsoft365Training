00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Creating strong passwords

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.006
is vitally important to maintaining the security

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.001
of your account on your computer,

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.007
and also for keeping yourself safe online.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.006
If your password is easily guessed,

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.003
all of your documents, photos, and other files

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:14.004
could potentially be viewed

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.009
by anyone with access to your computer.

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.001
When you first create an account on your operating system,

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.008
or when an account is created for you

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.009
by someone administering your computer,

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.009
a password is created for you to access your account.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.009
You can change your password at any time,

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.000
which you may want to do if you feel

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.007
your password isn't strong enough,

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.004
or that someone may have guessed your password.

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.002
But what exactly makes for a strong password?

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:39.003
Conventional wisdom often suggests these guidelines.

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.009
Your password should be at least eight characters in length.

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.006
Short passwords are easier to guess.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:48.000
It should be a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.009
There should be at least one capital letter,

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:51.008
and you'll want to avoid making it the first letter,

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.009
as that's a pretty common practice.

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.005
You also want to have at least one number

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.005
and at least one symbol.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.009
Exclamation points and hashtags are pretty common, though,

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.006
so try lesser-used symbols

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:05.000
like the greater or lesser than symbol or a comma.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.004
Also avoid using dates, numbers, or names

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.002
people know or can find out are associated with you,

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.004
at least as the only part of the password.

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.005
So don't use your birth date or your dog's name

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.002
or your maiden name, for example.

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.009
Lastly, avoid writing down your password on paper.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.001
If you have to write it down,

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:23.003
keep it physically secure or locked away,

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.009
and not just sitting next to your computer.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.007
Now with that said,

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.003
how do you create a secure password that you can remember?

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.001
There are different schools of thought on this.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.001
One suggestion is to think of a short phrase

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.003
that has meaning to you, but not a direct connection.

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.004
For example, "four score and seven years ago".

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:45.004
To make that into a password, I could change it to 4s&amp;7Ya.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.009
So in this case, the 4 represents four,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.003
the lowercase S stands for score,

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.002
the ampersand stands for the and, which also has the benefit

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.002
of being a less commonly used symbol,

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.004
the 7 for the seven, the Y for the year,

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.002
which I capitalized in this case,

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.003
and the A for ago.

00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:04.009
So this is a fairly secure password with a key phrase

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.005
that you can keep in your head without writing it down.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.006
Now, it doesn't have at least eight characters,

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.008
so I might add some symbols I'll easily remember

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.007
before and after the phrase.

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:15.004
Now, alternately, you can think of your password

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.008
as a pass phrase, and come up with a sentence

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.002
comprised of at least four to five words.

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:24.008
For example, MyDogMaxIsSuperKeen!

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:29.009
Or BiscottiGoesGreatWithCaramelCoffee!!

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.004
Even though both of those examples go against the suggestion

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:35.004
of not using exclamation points as your special character,

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.003
and neither of them include numbers,

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:38.009
they're both long enough that they'd be

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.007
very difficult for someone to guess,

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.005
unless they're phrases you often say out loud.

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.001
Now, a powerful computer might be able

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.005
to guess these passwords given enough time,

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:48.008
but most systems lock you out

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:51.005
after you exceed a reasonable number of password attempts,

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.007
usually around 10 attempts.

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.008
So passwords should be complex,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.001
but they also need to be memorable

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.007
so you can enter them relatively easy

00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:00.003
when you need to log in.

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:01.002
Be sure to take some time

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.000
to develop your own strong password

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.002
for your login information on your computer.
