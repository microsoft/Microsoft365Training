00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.009
- Another common device you'll most likely use

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.002
at some point or another

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.009
is an external hard drive or storage device.

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.006
An external drive can be a simple flash or thumb drive

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:10.008
like this one.

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.006
These typically plug into your computer's USB port,

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.001
and you can get them in a variety of capacities

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.000
depending on how much storage space you need.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.003
But for significantly more storage space,

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.002
you'll have to go with an external hard drive like this one.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.003
These can also connect to your computer via USB.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.006
You'll do need to be aware of the type of USB connector

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:31.000
that the drive uses though.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.002
Many drives still use the older standard USB connector

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.003
while newer drives use what's known as USB-C.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.007
You'll have to make sure that drives connector

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.005
is compatible with the USB ports on your computer.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:43.008
If they're not compatible, you'll need an adapter

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.007
or a different drive.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.004
Larger external drives often require

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.001
that you plug them into their own power outlet as well.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.004
Although you will find some models

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:54.002
that are powered through the USB port.

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.002
But using an external hard drive or a thumb drive

00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:01.001
is simply a matter of plugging it into your computer.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.002
After a moment, you should see an alert appear

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.000
to determine what to do with the external drive.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.005
I'll click that alert.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:08.009
And basically windows is asking

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.008
what you want to do with this storage device as detected.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.002
To view the contents of the drive,

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.007
choose Open folder to view files.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.005
And now we're seeing the contents of the drive I plugged

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:18.008
into my PC.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.008
Now, if the AutoPlay window didn't show up,

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.006
your preferences might have been changed.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.009
To check your preferences, go to the Start menu,

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.002
Settings, select Devices,

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.008
and select AutoPlay.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.007
And here makes sure Use AutoPlay for all media and devices

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.006
is switched on.
