00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Narrator] When you're working on a document,

00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
Word automatically checks for proper spelling and grammar,

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.008
which helps contribute to your documents looking

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.001
and sounding more professional.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.001
Word auto-corrects a lot of commonly misspelled words

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.002
as you type them,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:15.003
and it also highlights words that thinks may be misspelled.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.002
You'll see a squiggly red line like this one appear

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.003
under potentially misspelled words,

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.006
and words or phrases that may be grammatically incorrect

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.007
or vague will have these double blue underlines.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:25.009
Just right click an underlined word

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.000
to see a list of potential corrections.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.008
If one of the suggestions you see is correct,

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.004
just select it and it will instantly be changed

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:33.007
in your document.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.002
If you'd like to review all of the spelling

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.007
and grammar corrections at once,

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.002
go to the review tab and here click editor.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.000
That opens the editor pane to the right,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.004
which contains suggested corrections and refinements

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:45.009
to help improve your writing.

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.004
This allows you to move through the suggestions

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.001
in the document one at a time.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.009
I can see there are a total of six suggestions

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.003
that it's making in this document.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.004
One spelling suggestion and five grammar suggestions.

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.001
So I can select spelling.

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.009
That jumps me to the next misspelled word that it finds.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.008
And again, if you agree with one of these suggested fixes,

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.000
you can just select it to make that change.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In this case, honors would be correct.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.007
But we can also choose to ignore once,

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.007
which moves you to the next suggestion.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.000
Or you can choose ignore all to have Word ignore

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.003
a misspelling throughout the entire document.

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.002
This can be useful if it flags someone's name

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.005
as a misspelling, for example,

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.004
and you don't want it highlighted as a misspelling

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.001
throughout the entire document.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.009
There's also the option here to add the spelling

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.005
to Word's internal dictionary so it won't flag this

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.009
as a misspelling in other documents either.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.005
But in this case, this is definitely a misspelling,

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:33.001
so I'm going to make my change by selecting it.

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.003
And you can see now I fixed all of the spelling issues

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.003
as far as Word is concerned.

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:38.009
Next I can move on to grammar.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.006
It jumps to the word support,

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:41.006
and you can see it currently says

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.008
this mission statements support the creation.

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.007
That should definitely be supports.

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:48.003
So I could select that there to make that change.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:49.009
And it jumps to the next one.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.003
Notice when checking grammar,

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.008
we also have the ignore once option here.

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.002
By clicking that, it jumps to the next issue.

00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:57.006
With potential grammatical issues,

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.004
you can also expand this area here at the top of the pane

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.004
to see where it's grammar advice.

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:03.006
Of course you should always proofread

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.009
your documents yourself,

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.002
but Word's built in spelling and grammar proofing

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.007
can help you fix or improve your writing as well.
