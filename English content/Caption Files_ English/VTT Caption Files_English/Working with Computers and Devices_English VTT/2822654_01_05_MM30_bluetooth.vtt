00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:03.009
- Many of today's computers, especially portable devices,

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.002
like laptops and tablet computers,

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.008
include a technology called Bluetooth.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.006
Bluetooth is a short range wireless technology,

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.004
mostly used to reduce the use of cables.

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.001
You're probably familiar with this technology

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.001
in the form of Bluetooth headsets

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.001
that many people use to talk on their mobile phones.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.003
But Bluetooth is also used for many other types of devices,

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.007
like replacing a wired keyboard or mouse

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.003
to eliminate the clutter of cables

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:32.000
normally needed to connect those devices to your computer.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.006
Now, because we are dealing with a wireless technology,

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.001
the important thing is to make sure

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.005
that your Bluetooth device such as a mouse and your computer

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.009
recognize each other

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.002
and that someone nearby can't take control of your computer

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.003
with their Bluetooth mouse.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.002
You accomplish this

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.002
by performing a task called pairing your devices.

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.000
So let's take a look at how we do this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.008
For this example, I'm going to set up a Bluetooth mouse.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:55.008
The first thing you need to do

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:58.006
is to set your Bluetooth device into pairing mode

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.008
also called discoverable mode.

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.001
You'll have to check the instructions

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.006
for whatever device you're trying to pair with your computer

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.000
to see how to put it into this mode.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.005
I'll go ahead and do that to my mouse right now.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.002
Now, you may immediately see a notification

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.000
letting you know that your device was detected,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.005
and you'll be able to connect to it right from there.

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.001
If you don't see that notification or you miss clicking it,

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:21.005
you can go into settings to connect your device.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:22.004
Here in Windows 10,

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:27.009
I'm going to go to the Start menu, to Settings, Devices,

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.000
and I'll make sure that Bluetooth

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.001
and other devices is selected.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.001
I'll make sure that the Bluetooth switch is on,

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:36.000
and I'll click Add Bluetooth or other device.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.006
I'll say that I want to connect a Bluetooth device.

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:41.006
And after a moment, my mouse's name appears in this window.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.002
I can select it,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.006
and Windows will just take a moment to install the device.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:46.008
Now, depending on your device,

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.007
you might be prompted to type in a passcode

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.000
in order to complete the pairing process.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.003
This is an extra security measure some devices use

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:55.003
to make sure the person controlling the computer

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.006
is the one who wants to pair with the device.

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.004
If your device requires a passcode,

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.006
you'll find the code in your instruction manual.

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.005
But as you just saw,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.000
that wasn't required for this mouse,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and after a few seconds,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.005
I got this message saying my device is ready to go.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.009
I'll click Done.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.004
I see my device listed here,

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.005
and I can begin using my mouse right away.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:15.001
Now, you only need to set up your Bluetooth device once.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.009
After that, anytime your Bluetooth mouse, keyboard,

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:19.002
or any other paired device

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:20.008
is switched on near your computer,

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:22.007
they should automatically connect.

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.009
Now, if you ever want to unpair your mouse from your PC,

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.005
just come back into Bluetooth settings, select the device,

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:32.002
click Remove Device and confirm that you want to do that.

00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:33.004
You can see it's been removed

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.005
and now this mouse will no longer work with my computer

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.002
until I pair them again.

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:38.002
And that's it.

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.003
This pairing process is pretty much the same

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:42.007
regardless of the type of device you're using.

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.006
Just put your device into pairing or discoverable mode,

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.002
open up Bluetooth settings, select your device,

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:49.006
and let windows do the rest.
