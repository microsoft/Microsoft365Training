00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Instructor] Let's take a look at how to create

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:03.007
a basic spreadsheet from scratch.

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:04.009
At its most basic level,

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.001
a spreadsheet is the digital equivalent

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.000
of a paper ledger sheet.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.008
Like ledgers, spreadsheets are comprised of a grid of rows

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.006
and columns and can be used for balancing your checkbook,

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.000
calculating loans, managing the address

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and contact information of customers, and so on.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.001
One of the advantages of spreadsheet programs

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.007
is that they can quickly perform complex calculations

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.008
once you've set them up to do so.

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.004
I'll start by creating a new blank workbook,

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.003
and I'll make that a little larger so we can see it better.

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.005
Let's say I'm trying to decide between taking two jobs

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.007
at an hourly rate.

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.000
One pays more per hour

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.003
but offers slightly fewer hours than the one that pays less.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:43.001
I'll start by using the first row of columns, B and C,

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.006
as the headers for the two job calculations.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.009
To type into a cell, we just click it.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:50.005
I'll type Job A into B1.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.002
To move horizontally from cell to cell,

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.005
you can press the Tab key on your keyboard.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:55.004
You can go back to the left

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.004
by holding Shift as you press Tab.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.005
But in this case, I do want to type into cell C1,

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.009
so I'll press Tab again,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.007
and I'll label this Job B.

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.006
And I'll use column A to label all the rows

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:09.002
I'm going to need, starting with Hourly Wage.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, pressing Enter or Return on your keyboard

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.008
let's you move down a single column.

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.004
Holding Shift while pressing Return moves you back up.

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.005
But in this case, I want to go down.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.003
And I'll quickly add two more rows of labels

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:24.002
for Hours per week and Annual Income.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.000
Now, column A isn't quite wide enough

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.005
for the text that I've typed.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.003
So I'll place my mouse cursor between columns A and B.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.003
When I see this vertical line

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.007
with two arrows pointing either way,

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:34.005
I can click and drag to the right

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.006
to make column A a little wider.

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:39.002
Okay, so, so far we've added labels to these cells.

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.002
Cells containing only text and no numbers

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.008
are generally referred to as labels.

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:46.005
Next, I'm going to add the data that I know about each job,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.005
starting with the Hourly Wage.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:52.008
Let's say the hourly wage for job A is 1475.

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.005
I'll press Tab to enter it and move to the next cell.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.007
And let's make job B's hourly wage 1585.

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.007
So that's the basics of creating a spreadsheet

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.002
and entering data into it.

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:04.007
Now, there's a lot more we can do here,

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:05.008
like formatting the cells

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.006
to only accept certain types of data.

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.000
For example, I could set up the sheet

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.005
so only numbers could be entered into the job columns,

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.009
and we can also add formulas to automatically calculate

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.006
the wages based on the number of available hours.

00:02:16.006 --> 00:02:18.009
But it all starts with first entering some basic content

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.001
into your spreadsheet like we've done here.
