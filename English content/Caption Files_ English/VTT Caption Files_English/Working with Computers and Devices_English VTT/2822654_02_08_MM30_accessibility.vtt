00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.002
- [Instructor] Modern computer operating systems

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.009
are designed with the needs of everyone in mind.

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.007
For example, there's a wide range of tools

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.003
and accessibility features built into Windows 10

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.003
that make it easier to use your computer

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.004
if you have certain disabilities or challenges.

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.000
These features often need to be enabled

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.001
before you can take advantage of them.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.005
Many of the Windows 10 accessibility features can be found

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:24.007
by going to the start menu, to Settings,

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.005
and here click Ease of Access.

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.008
In the left column, you'll find accessibility categories

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.007
to access settings for vision, hearing, and interaction.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.007
For example, under Vision, we can select Display,

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.003
and here you can change the size of the text

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.002
in applications you're viewing.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.004
The slider here under Make text bigger

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.003
lets you customize the default size of text.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.004
When it looks good to you, you can click Apply,

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.005
and you can see that instantly makes all the text,

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.004
including the text in the Setting window, larger.

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.002
I'm going to set that back.

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.002
If you need to make not just text larger,

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.003
but the windows and other elements as well,

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:01.009
you can select a percentage value here

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.004
under Make everything bigger.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.008
You can see mine's currently set to 200%.

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:08.000
If I restore the window here so we can see some

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.005
of the elements like the Recycle Bin here,

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:16.004
I can make it larger or even smaller.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:21.009
I'm going to set that back to the 200% setting where it was.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.005
And below that under Make everything brighter,

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.001
you can change the brightness of your display.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.002
Moving to Cursor &amp; pointer size,

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.000
here you can make adjustments like increasing the size

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.008
of the mouse cursor to make it easier to see.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:37.000
Notice as I click these, the size changes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.002
And you can also change its color.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.007
Above that, you can change the thickness of text cursors

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.001
so they're easier to see when you're typing.

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.002
Next, we have the magnifier.

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:50.005
Enabling the magnifier zooms you into the screen

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.008
at the selected size, currently set to 200% here.

00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:57.002
And that can make things easier to see or read.

00:01:57.002 --> 00:01:59.006
And you can just move your mouse around the screen

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.005
to see other parts of the display.

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.005
Turn that off again for now.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.004
So those are some of the useful vision settings.

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.000
Under Hearing, you can select Audio,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.004
and here you can set alerts where you'll be alerted visually

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.003
so you don't miss audible alerts.

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.009
So for example, I could choose Flash the active window

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.000
so when an application I'm using beeps,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.008
the window I'm currently using will also flash.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:22.007
Under the Interaction category,

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.006
there are several settings based on your interaction

00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:27.002
with input devices, like the keyboard, mouse,

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.000
speech, and eye control.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.003
Under Keyboard, for example,

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:33.003
there's an option to use an onscreen keyboard

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:34.009
which we can enable.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.004
This is useful on devices without a physical keyboard,

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.003
but also for anyone who might have difficulties

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:42.002
using a physical keyboard and can better control the mouse

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.007
to input text with this virtual keyboard.

00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.005
So this has been just a few examples

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.001
of the many features found in Windows

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.002
and other operating systems that improve accessibility

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.008
and allow you to use your computer more effectively.
