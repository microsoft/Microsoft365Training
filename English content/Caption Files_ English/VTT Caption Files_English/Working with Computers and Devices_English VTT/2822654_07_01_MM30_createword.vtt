00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.003
- The first step to working in Microsoft Word is

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.000
to open an existing document

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.003
or to create a brand-new document.

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.007
If you're creating a new document,

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:11.007
you can start from scratch with a completely blank document

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.008
or use one of the many available templates included

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:15.007
with Office to create documents

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:20.000
like resumes, flyers, reports, and more.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.009
To create a new document, open up Word.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.008
And from here, we can select Blank document

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.005
to instantly create a new empty Word document.

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.007
And you can start typing.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.001
Or to create a new document based on a template,

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.005
from here, you can go to File, select New,

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.002
and below the Blank document option,

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.008
you'll find a large collection of templates to choose from.

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.000
You can scroll through to browse the templates

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.001
or scroll back up and type a search term

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.009
to look for online templates.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.007
I'll search for newsletter.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.004
That gives me several results.

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.008
Click any template to get a closer look

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.003
and to read a description.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.001
And when you find a template you'd like to use,

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.000
click Create.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.005
That generates a new document based on that template,

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.004
and you can start replacing the placeholder text

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:05.000
and images with your own.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.003
Once you add text and other content to your document,

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.005
you should save the document,

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.002
so you don't lose your changes.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.002
One way to do this is to click File

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:14.008
and Save As.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:16.008
Then choose a location to save the file.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.005
If you have a OneDrive account set up,

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.000
you can save to your OneDrive folder

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.006
to save your document to the cloud,

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:22.007
so you'll be able to access it

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.002
from anywhere on any device running Word.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.006
Or you can choose to save it locally

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:30.003
to the computer you're currently using by choosing Browse.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:32.000
Navigate to the location on your computer

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.009
where you want to save your file.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.001
I'll choose my Documents folder.

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.009
Then name your file.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.008
I'll call this AugustNewsletter, and I'll click Save.

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:45.001
And now this is saved to my Documents folder.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.000
I can check that by going to the Start menu

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.006
and selecting Documents from here

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.008
to jump to my Documents folder,

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:53.005
and there's my newsletter.

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:54.005
And now I can close this

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.008
and continue working on my newsletter here in Word.

00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.001
As you work, it's a good idea to periodically save your file

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.002
to make sure you don't lose your changes.

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.001
Once you've saved your file the first time,

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.005
you can quickly save it again by clicking the Save button

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:08.002
at the top of the Word window.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:09.009
So that's how to create a new document,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.008
start editing it, and how to save it.
