00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] When you first start up your computer,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.006
the first thing to load is the operating system.

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.000
For example, Windows 10 is the most recent version

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.002
of the Windows operating system that comes pre-installed

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.008
on many PCs and tablet devices.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.005
Here we'll explore the basics of navigating

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.008
around an operating system using Windows 10,

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.003
but many of these concepts carry over

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.000
to other operating systems as well.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
When you start started the computer,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.001
you'll usually see a screen to log into your account

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.005
on that computer.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.003
Generally, it's a good idea for each person

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.004
using a computer to have their own account

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:31.003
rather than sharing an account between multiple users.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.008
Individual accounts allow each user to keep their files

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:35.005
and work secured and organized

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.000
and let users personalize their experience on the computer.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.001
For example, one user could set the computer

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:42.006
to display text in English

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.005
while another user could set it to display in Spanish

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.007
and because accounts are secured by passwords,

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.002
neither user can see the other's documents or other files.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.005
To log into the computer, select your username,

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.004
or sometimes you'll enter it manually

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:56.007
and then type in your password.

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.001
In Windows 10 when you set up your account,

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:00.004
you also have the option of setting up

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.008
a personal identification number or pin

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.002
which you can enter instead of your password.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.005
So you'll either enter a password or a pin

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:08.009
in this case, I'm entering a password

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.003
and I'll press Enter on my keyboard

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.007
and that's going to log me into the computer.

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.004
Once you're logged in, the first thing you see

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:17.003
is your computer desktop.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.004
Similar to a real physical desktop,

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.005
your computer desktop is where you store files

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.003
you're currently working with.

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.002
In most operating systems, you can personalize

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.008
the look of your desktop by changing the background image,

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:31.004
sometimes called the wallpaper or by changing the colors.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.005
At the bottom of the Windows 10 desktop is the task bar,

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.002
which is an essential tool for working

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.002
with the Windows operating system.

00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:39.009
Depending on how you have it set up,

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.004
in the task bar you can see what apps are currently running,

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:43.008
what the current time is,

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:46.006
what appointments are on your calendar and so on.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.008
On the far left of the task bar,

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.005
you'll find the Start button.

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.008
Clicking it opens up the Start menu

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:52.006
and this is where you can find

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:55.004
all the applications installed in your device.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.005
This is also where you'll find the buttons to log off,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:00.000
restart and shut down the computer.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.006
For now, let's click outside the Start menu

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:04.001
to close it without selecting anything.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.004
Next to the Start button is the search box

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:08.003
where you can search for applications by name

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.001
or search for files and documents on your device.

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.008
Using the search box can be a lot quicker

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:15.008
than manually looking for applications in the Start menu.

00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:17.005
Just start typing the name of the application

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:18.009
or document you want to work with

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.000
and Windows will display the search results as you type.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.008
For example, if I wanted to quickly open the calculator app,

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:27.002
I could just start typing calculator,

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.009
there it is, and I can just press Enter on my keyboard

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.003
to open that up.

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.006
Next to the search box, you'll see icons for applications

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:36.006
that are currently running or pinned to the task bar.

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:38.003
Pinned applications are apps that you can place

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:40.003
in the task bar to quickly access again

00:02:40.003 --> 00:02:41.008
so you don't have to dig through the Start menu

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.002
to find them each time you want to open them.

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:45.006
Applications that are currently running

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:46.007
have a line underneath them

00:02:46.007 --> 00:02:48.009
so you can easily tell if they're in use

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.004
as you can see here under the calculator icon.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.001
To pin an application to the task bar,

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.006
place your mouse cursor over it

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.005
and then click the right mouse button on your mouse

00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:00.000
or pointing device, this is referred to as right click,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.007
which often brings up a menu containing several options.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.007
In this case, I'll choose to pin the calculator app

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.006
to the task bar since I use it a lot.

00:03:07.006 --> 00:03:09.007
So now even if I close the calculator app

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.003
by clicking the X button here in the upper right corner,

00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:14.005
notice this icon stays in the task bar.

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.009
We no longer see the blue line under it

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.002
because it's not running, but I can easily click

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.007
to open the calculator app from here now.

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.004
Also here within the pinned and running apps

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.002
is File Explorer.

00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:26.000
Clicking that opens up a window you can use

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.009
to browse the files on your computer

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.000
and I'll just close that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.004
The last section of the task bar is here on the right.

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:34.002
Here you usually see the date and time

00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:35.009
along with various other icons

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.004
depending on how the computer's task bar

00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.000
has been customized.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.008
Clicking on icons can give you more information

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:42.000
about the computer.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.001
For example, clicking on the clock, displays the calendar,

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.002
clicking on the network icon

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.006
shows you the status of your network connection.

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:53.005
Clicking this arrow here reveals other icons

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:55.004
that may be hidden so the task bar isn't cluttered

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.003
with too many icons at once.

00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:00.003
So for example, from here, I can click the speaker icon

00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:01.005
and that allows me to adjust the volume

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:03.009
of the computer speakers.

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.003
So that's the task bar in Windows.

00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:07.007
Now, when you're done using your computer,

00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:10.001
it's usually a good idea to log out of your account

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:11.004
or to shut down the computer

00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.004
if you don't need to leave it running.

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:15.005
To do so, click the Start button.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.008
If you just want to log out, but leave the computer running,

00:04:17.008 --> 00:04:19.009
for example, if someone else needs to log into their account

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.002
to use the computer, just click the user icon

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:26.000
at the top here, and then choose a Sign Out.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.003
That will log you out of your account,

00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:28.003
but leave the computer running

00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:31.000
so someone else can sign into their account.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Ultimately, you can click the power button here

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.008
and from here, you can shut down or restart the computer.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:39.002
Choose to Shut Down if you want to shut down the computer

00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:41.003
so it's not using any power.

00:04:41.003 --> 00:04:42.009
And restart shuts down the computer

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.001
and immediately starts it again.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:46.008
Sometimes restarting can fix issues

00:04:46.008 --> 00:04:49.009
that may crop up while using the computer.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.009
Again, we've been looking at the

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.001
Windows 10 operating system in this video,

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:55.007
but many of these concepts like searching for applications,

00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:58.004
accessing settings and logging out and restarting

00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:00.006
apply to other operating systems as well.
