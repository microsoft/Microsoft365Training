00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Illustrator] One of the most important concepts

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.008
to understand when working with computers

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.008
is the system for organizing, storing,

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:08.005
and locating your files and applications.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.004
In this context, the term file, it refers to a single item,

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.001
such as a word processing document, a photo,

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.009
a video clip, a song and so on.

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.007
Applications are the programs that run on your computer,

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:21.004
which often use, interact with,

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.007
or create the files stored on your computer.

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.001
Another term you'll frequently hear is folder.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.006
A folder is sometimes referred to as a directory,

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:29.009
but I think folder makes more sense

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.004
because it's easy to understand the concept of storing files

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:33.009
within folders.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.000
Again, we're using the Windows 10 operating system

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.002
here for these examples,

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.006
but the concept recovering applied

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.006
to other operating systems as well.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.007
Here in Windows 10, I'm going to click the file Explorer icon,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.008
and that opens up a new window where we can navigate

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.006
and explore the contents of the computer.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.009
But in this case, let's say I want to create a new folder

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.005
to store some of my business documents.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:56.009
Now in each account, you already have some folders created,

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.003
which you can see over here in the left sidebar.

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:00.009
Let's click documents,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.006
which is a good place to start my business documents.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.000
You can see I already have a couple of files

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.001
and folders inside the documents folder,

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.001
but to stay organized,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.003
I'm going to create a new folder

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.009
for my business-related documents.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.000
There are a couple of ways to do this, but for this example,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'll click the home tab, here at the top of the window

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.004
and then select new folder.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:20.008
And there it is.

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.008
By default, it's called New folder,

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.003
but notice the name is highlighted.

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.006
Meaning if I start typing while the text is selected,

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.008
I can give it a more meaningful name.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.007
I'll call this folder business

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.006
and I'll press enter.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.001
So there's my new folder.

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.007
I can open it by double-clicking it.

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:38.005
And as you'd expect, it's currently empty

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.004
because we just created it.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.009
Now, just like how there are several ways

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.002
to create a new folder,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.008
there are several ways to add files to that folder.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:48.000
For example, if I were working in Microsoft Excel

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.009
on a spreadsheet,

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.001
I could save that spreadsheet

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.004
and choose to store it in this folder.

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:55.005
Alternately, I can click the home tab again,

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.006
click the new item menu,

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.006
and here I'll find options for several types of files

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.000
I can create.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.005
So for example, I want to create a text document.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.009
So I'll select that option,

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.000
and that instantly generates a new text document

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.006
inside this folder.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.003
Just like when we created this folder,

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:13.008
the generic name of this new text document is highlighted,

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.009
so I can give it a better name.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.001
Now, if you don't start typing

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.006
and you click outside that name,

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.002
you'll see that the highlight around the text is removed.

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:23.000
I can still rename this file though.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.003
I just need to click it once to select it,

00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.005
pause for a second and then click it again.

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.006
And you can see the name highlights again.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.005
The reason for pausing between clicks

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:34.004
is that if you click twice too quickly,

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:35.008
that's considered a Double-Click

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.007
which opens the item instead of highlighting its name.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.002
So let's say I want to use this document

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.007
to keep some ideas for a book I'm working on.

00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:46.005
I'll call this Book Ideas and I'll press return.

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.003
And now if I want to start working on this file,

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:49.009
I can double-click it,

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.008
which opens it in the default text editing application.

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:57.004
And I can start typing out some of my ideas

00:02:57.004 --> 00:03:00.001
when I close this file,

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.007
I'm prompted to save it so I don't lose my changes.

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.004
I'll click save.

00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:08.004
And now I've created, edited and saved a text document.

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:09.005
But now that I think about it,

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.009
this doesn't really belong in this business folder.

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:15.001
Instead, I want to store this in a folder for my book ideas.

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.001
So I'll click the back button to go back

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:19.000
to the main document folder,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.006
and here I'll create a new folder for my book ideas.

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:22.008
Another way to create a new folder

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:24.009
is to right-click within the folder

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.008
and then choose new folder.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:32.002
There it is and I'll call this books.

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:34.001
Now, I need to move that book ideas document

00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.000
I created in the business folder into the books folder.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.001
Again, there are multiple ways to do this.

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:41.009
For this example, let's go back into the business folder

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:43.006
where that file currently is,

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:46.005
and now select it by clicking it once,

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:48.005
and I'll go to the home tab

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:50.006
and here I'll choose move to.

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:52.003
This gives me a list of folders on my computer

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.003
that I may want to move this file to,

00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:56.009
but I don't see that new books folder I just created.

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.006
So I'll browse for that folder by selecting choose location.

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.005
This lets me navigate my entire computer

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.004
to locate the folder I need.

00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:06.007
I'll start by opening up my user folder.

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:09.005
Here I'll find documents and within documents,

00:04:09.005 --> 00:04:11.007
here's that new book's folder I created.

00:04:11.007 --> 00:04:14.006
I'll select that and I'll choose move.

00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:15.005
And just like that,

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.006
the file disappears out of the business folder.

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:20.001
And if I go back to the main documents folder

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:23.005
and look in books, there's the text file.

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:24.007
Now, another way to move files

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:27.003
is to simply drag them where you want them to be.

00:04:27.003 --> 00:04:28.007
For example, if I want this file stored

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.003
in my main documents folder,

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:33.004
I can simply click and hold down on my mouse button

00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:35.002
and then drag it to the document folder listing here

00:04:35.002 --> 00:04:36.003
on the sidebar.

00:04:36.003 --> 00:04:39.003
It says move to documents I'll release my mouse button,

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:41.002
and if I go back to the documents folder,

00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:44.001
which I can do by clicking on documents up here this time,

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:45.007
you'll see book ideas is now sitting here

00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:47.000
in the main folder.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.004
But of course it really does make more sense

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:50.003
to leave it in the new book's folder here.

00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:53.001
So I'll drag it back in like so.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.005
Now, if you no longer need a file,

00:04:54.005 --> 00:04:56.006
you can always just delete it.

00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:58.009
If I want to get rid of this Book Ideas file,

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.004
I can just select it,

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:04.002
and then under the home tab I can choose delete,

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:05.007
and it's gone.

00:05:05.007 --> 00:05:07.009
Deleting files sends them to the recycle bin

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.008
on your desktop, which I can double-click to open.

00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:12.009
And there it is.

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.005
So you don't have to worry about accidentally

00:05:14.005 --> 00:05:15.007
deleting files.

00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:18.003
If you made a mistake or you went to undelete a file,

00:05:18.003 --> 00:05:20.000
you can just find it in the recycle bin.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.007
As long as you haven't emptied the recycle bin,

00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:23.008
which does permanently delete your files

00:05:23.008 --> 00:05:25.005
and then just drag the file to place it back

00:05:25.005 --> 00:05:28.008
into its folder or anywhere else you want to store it.

00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:30.008
So if I move this window slightly out of the way,

00:05:30.008 --> 00:05:32.002
I can grab book ideas

00:05:32.002 --> 00:05:35.005
and drag it back into the books folder.

00:05:35.005 --> 00:05:37.005
So that's how to create new folders and files

00:05:37.005 --> 00:05:38.008
and how to move, delete,

00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:40.001
and recover those files.
