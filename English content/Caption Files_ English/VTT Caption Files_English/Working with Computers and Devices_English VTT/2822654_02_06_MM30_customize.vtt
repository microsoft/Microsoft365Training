00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Operating systems are highly customizable,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.002
making it easy to personalize your experience

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.008
to be more suited to everything from the way you work

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.006
to your personal taste and images and colors.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.003
Let's take a look at some of the most popular ways

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:13.007
to customize the look and feel

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.005
of the Windows 10 operating system.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:20.009
I'll click the Start button and select Settings.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.007
And here in the Settings window, select personalization.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.003
This is where you'll find the majority of settings

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:29.003
for personalizing your Windows 10 experience.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.005
For example, to customize the look of your desktop,

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.005
make sure background is selected.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.002
You can see I currently have a solid color

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.002
selected for my background.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.007
And that lets you select any of these colors

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:43.004
to instantly apply them to your desktop.

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.007
Picture lets you choose from built in Windows photos,

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.005
like the ones you see here.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.008
Or you can click Browse to choose

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.001
from one of your own photos from somewhere on your computer.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.006
And slideshow lets you select

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.001
a folder of photos on your computer

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.009
and it will randomly display those photos

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:01.000
as your background.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.005
You can choose how often the photo changes

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.006
with this menu here.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.001
Personally, I prefer a solid color,

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.006
so I'm going to switch back to that.

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:10.002
But you're free to customize your own background

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.002
however you like.

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.008
The color settings where you can customize

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.009
the colors of the operating systems various elements.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.004
So here I can select from a variety of colors.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.001
So I can switch from blue to red.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.001
And this preview image at the top gives you an idea

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.005
of what will be affected by your choices.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.003
But I can also see the changes right away.

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.004
Notice if I come down to my Start button, it's already red.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.000
And many of the items within the start menu

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.006
are also highlighted in red.

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.006
If I scroll down a bit under default app mode,

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.007
I can choose light or dark,

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.004
basically letting me choose the overall mode

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.001
for the operating system.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.000
So if your eyes are sensitive to bright lights,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.007
you might want to choose the dark mode.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.009
So using the computer screen for extended periods

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.004
is less straining.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.007
I'll just switch back to light for now.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:55.007
If you find it difficult to find a color combination

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.008
that works for you, try the theme settings.

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.004
Themes or groups of background images, colors, sounds

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.006
and so on, that have been designed to work well together.

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.001
Here you'll find some pre installed themes

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:11.001
that you can click on, and you can try a few of these out.

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.000
And you can see how that affects

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the look of the operating system.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.005
You can search for more themes in the Microsoft Store,

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.009
where it says get more themes in Microsoft Store,

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.008
or you can even further customize the theme.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:22.006
So for example, if you like everything about the theme

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:25.008
except the color scheme, you can click the color option

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.006
and go back and select a different accent color.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.008
I'm going to go back to themes

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:33.009
and set that back to my original theme for now.

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:37.000
Now lastly, you can also customize the taskbar.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.009
Within the settings you can lock or unlock the taskbar

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.006
to prevent accidentally moving or resizing it.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.002
Under automatically hide the taskbar

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:46.004
you can enable this option to hide the taskbar hide

00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:49.001
from view until you move your mouse to its location,

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.004
that can give you a little more space to work with.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:54.003
You can also choose use small Taskbar buttons,

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:55.002
which gives you more room

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.009
if you've pinned a lot of applications to the taskbar.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.003
And under taskbar location on screen,

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:02.005
you can even move the taskbar to other locations

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:04.006
like the left, right or top of the screen,

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:06.001
which you might want to do if an application

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.007
you're working with has menus or buttons

00:03:07.007 --> 00:03:08.008
at the bottom of the screen,

00:03:08.008 --> 00:03:10.009
and you don't want to accidentally click the taskbar

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.005
while working in the app.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:15.000
So as you can see, it's pretty easy to customize Window 10

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.006
to personalize its appearance to work best for you.
