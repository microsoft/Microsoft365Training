00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] In addition to the applications you use

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.008
on your desktop or laptop computer,

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.006
you'll probably also spend a lot of time

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.000
working with apps on your mobile phone or tablet.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.005
Apps behave similarly on mobile devices

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:12.009
compared to desktop apps,

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.007
but you'll often find more limitations to mobile apps

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.007
in terms of power, functionality and ease of use.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:21.003
Now, this isn't to say that you can't get work done,

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.009
play games and perform other tasks on your mobile phone.

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.005
You definitely can.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.007
And apps for mobile devices

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.002
are usually designed specifically

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.009
for optimizing the experience of using a smaller screen

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.004
and a virtual keyboard.

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.002
Mobile apps are generally good for brief periods of work,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.004
especially on phones.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.004
Tablets with their larger screens

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.009
are more suitable for extended periods of work.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.009
But with the prevalence of wifi

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.006
and cellular connections on mobile devices these days,

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.007
it's easy to not just to work and play on a mobile device,

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:52.003
but also to continue your work on a desktop computer later.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.005
For example, let's say I'm working on a document here

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.006
in Microsoft Word on my phone during my morning commute.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.003
It's a little difficult to see, but I can zoom in.

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:01.005
And when I need to make edits,

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:04.000
I can just tap on the screen and a keyboard will appear.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.003
Now, I have this document saved over the internet

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.009
to my OneDrive account, which is a cloud-based service

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.000
I can store my documents on.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.002
Then, later, when I arrive at my office,

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.002
I can open up the desktop version of Word

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.003
and here open the same document from OneDrive

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:18.005
and keep working on it.

00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:20.001
But now, on a much larger screen

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.006
with a full range of editing tools

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:23.009
found in the desktop version of Word.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.002
Or I might add a lunch meeting to my calendar

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.005
here in Microsoft Outlook on my computer.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.006
But later, on my commute home,

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:32.008
I realize I need to change the appointment to another day.

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.003
I can open up the mobile version of Outlook on my phone,

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:40.008
see all of my appointments and make my changes.

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.001
You'll find that many work and productivity apps

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:45.004
now have this ability to sync over the internet

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.003
so you can work seamlessly between devices,

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.009
making your mobile devices

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.004
an extension of your desktop computer, in a sense.

00:01:51.004 --> 00:01:53.004
But lots of mobile apps are also designed

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.004
as standalone apps on your phone or tablet,

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.009
apps that are designed for a quick check of the weather,

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.008
or for finding driving directions,

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.007
or to check on the status of a flight.

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.005
Probably one of the biggest differences

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.000
between mobile and desktop apps

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.003
is that while you can acquire desktop apps

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:08.006
through many different places,

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:11.003
like the Microsoft Store or an app developer's website,

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.003
or purchase physical copies of applications in a store,

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:16.004
although, that's becoming less and less common,

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.001
mobile apps, on the other hand,

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.009
are acquired only through dedicated stores

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.004
like the Google Play Store

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.003
for apps that run on Android mobile devices,

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.009
and the Apple App Store

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.002
for apps that run on Apple's iOS mobile operating system.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:31.000
These mobile app stores are your one-stop location

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.003
for every app you may want to install on your device.

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.006
You can browse through multiple categories,

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.007
or use the search feature to find specific apps.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.002
When you select an app, you can read about its features,

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.007
check out reviews from people who have used the app.

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:44.009
And if you want the app,

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:48.001
you can download or purchase it to immediately install it.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.007
Once apps are installed, you'll find their icons

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.006
among all the other apps you have on your device,

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.002
and you can tap them to start using them right away.
