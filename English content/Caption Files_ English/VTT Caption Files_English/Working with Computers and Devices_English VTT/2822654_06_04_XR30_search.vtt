00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] When learning to use the apps

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:02.008
in Microsoft Office,

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.000
it can sometimes take a little time to find the features

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.002
and tools needed for your work.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.006
But at the top of each Office app,

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.004
you'll find the search bar.

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.004
In some applications, a search bar like this

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.002
often lets you look up instructions on how

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.005
to accomplish tasks or locate the features you need.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.008
But the Microsoft search field goes a step further

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.001
by giving direct access to the features you need

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.005
without having to hunt through the tabs

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.005
in the ribbon or in the menu bar.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.001
For example, I'm currently working in this Word document

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:29.004
and maybe I want to look up how

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.003
to adjust the size of margins on the page.

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:35.006
So I'll click in the search field and type margins.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.004
So at the bottom, I can see that it searched my document

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.001
for the word margins in case that's what I'm looking for,

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:41.005
and there are no results there.

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.005
Above that, I can roll my mouse over the Get Help On section

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:45.007
to read entries about where to go in Word

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.006
to adjust margins.

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.003
There's even a dictionary definition of margins here,

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.008
but what I'm really interested in is this Best Action area

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:53.009
at the top.

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.006
This actually gives me access to the settings

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.006
to adjust the margins right from here.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.008
I don't need to hunt around anywhere else in Word,

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.007
I can just select, say, the Narrow setting

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.005
and that adjustment is instantly made to my document.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.004
Or maybe I want to adjust the space between paragraphs.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:11.009
I'll select my text here and in the search field,

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.003
I'll type spacing.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.001
Again, under Best Action, Word is offering access

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.002
to what it thinks are the settings I most likely want,

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.004
in this case line and paragraph spacing.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.002
But you may find other suggestions under Actions,

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:25.004
and here's the paragraph spacing I want.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:26.007
That opens the correct window for me,

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.005
where I can find the paragraph spacing settings,

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.006
make some changes and click Okay.

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.003
So the Microsoft search bar is a great tool to turn to

00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:36.002
anytime there's a feature you can't find,

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.004
or you're not sure how to accomplish a task.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.009
Just type in what you're looking for,

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.005
check the actions that it lists

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.004
and make your adjustments from there.
