00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.003
- If you often have to move between different types of tasks

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.008
for work like writing documents, creating spreadsheets,

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:10.001
putting together presentations, and handling your calendar,

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:11.004
you could do all of these things

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:12.009
with several individual apps

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.001
from multiple software developers,

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.001
but it often makes more sense to work with apps

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.001
that have been designed to work together,

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.000
giving you the ability to move seamlessly between them.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.006
Microsoft Office, for example,

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.009
is a collection of applications designed to work

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.005
in conjunction with each other to make it easier for you

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.000
to accomplish tasks and get things done.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.005
Office includes applications like Word for word processing,

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.007
Excel for working with spreadsheets,

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.001
and PowerPoint for creating slideshow presentations.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.003
There are versions of Office available for Windows

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:45.006
and Mac operating systems, mobile operating systems,

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.000
as well as an online version that can be accessed

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.003
from any computer's web browsing application,

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:54.001
regardless of the operating system it's running.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.006
It's a good idea to explore different software suites

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.003
to find the one that will be best suited

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.003
for the type of work you do.

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.005
Other software packages similar to Office

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.004
include Apple's iWork suite,

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.006
which includes Pages, Numbers, and Keynote

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.000
for creating documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.003
If you're a Mac user, you may want to consider these apps

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.008
since they're included for free on all macOS computers.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.002
Similarly, Google's online G Suite is also free

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.003
for consumers and includes apps like Google Docs, Sheets,

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.003
and Slides to create your documents,

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.005
spreadsheets, and presentations.

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:28.009
So be sure to look at these and other alternatives

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.003
when deciding which software to use.

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.009
In this course, we'll be focusing on Microsoft Office

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.001
as it's the most widely used

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.001
of these productivity suites of applications.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.007
There are two main versions of Microsoft Office available,

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:45.001
currently named Microsoft 365 and Office 2019.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.007
Microsoft 365 is a subscription-based version

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.003
of the suite of applications.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:50.007
There are multiple subscription plans

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:55.004
like Microsoft 365 Personal, Microsoft 365 Home &amp; Student,

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:59.004
and Microsoft 365 Business Premium, among others.

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:00.008
The cost of the subscription depends

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:02.002
on which plan you choose,

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.005
and the apps contained in each version can vary,

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:07.000
although they all contain the most popular applications,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.007
including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:13.002
With your subscription, you can install the software

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:15.007
on up to five Windows machines or Macs,

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.007
five tablet devices, and five mobile devices,

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.007
which is convenient if others in your household need

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.009
to use the software too.

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.006
Your subscription also includes the many software updates

00:02:25.006 --> 00:02:27.003
that Microsoft regularly releases

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.004
for the suite of applications.

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.000
These updates can include bug fixes

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.006
as well as new features and abilities.

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:36.004
As long as you pay your monthly or annual subscription fees,

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.009
you'll continue to have access to the latest versions

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:42.005
of all the applications included in your plan.

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:46.000
Office 2019, on the other hand, is a one-time purchase.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.009
Unlike Microsoft 365, you pay a single price

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:52.000
for access to all the applications in Office 2019,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
with no future fees or charges.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.001
The software is yours to use indefinitely.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:59.003
You need to keep in mind that your purchase only allows you

00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:01.004
to install the software on a single computer

00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:04.006
rather than multiple computers and mobile devices.

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:06.006
You also don't get access to any new features

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.002
or other updates with Office 2019.

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:11.002
So if you want to update to a new version months

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:12.002
or years later,

00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:15.000
you'll have to pay for that new version as well.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.002
So which version you choose depends a lot

00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:19.004
on how much you'll be using the Office applications

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:21.003
and if having access to the latest versions

00:03:21.003 --> 00:03:23.005
of the software is important to you.

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:26.005
For example, if you need the ability to work across devices,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.007
like if you want to be able to work on an Excel spreadsheet

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.001
on your phone during a commute

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.003
and later pick up where you left off on that spreadsheet

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.005
from your desktop computer or tablet,

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:37.007
you'll want to go with Microsoft 365.

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:40.002
On the other hand, if you know you need Word, Excel,

00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:42.009
or PowerPoint, but you use them infrequently enough

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.001
that you don't need the latest versions or features

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.007
or to work on your files between multiple devices,

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:50.008
Office 2019 is probably better suited for you.

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.006
Lastly, if your use of Office products is very infrequent,

00:03:53.006 --> 00:03:55.003
you can access free versions of most

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:58.008
of the Office applications online at office.com.

00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:01.001
These are lightweight versions of the Office products,

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.006
but they have a lot of the functionality

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.005
of their full-featured counterparts.

00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:06.008
And again, you can check them out for free at office.com

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.005
to see if they'll work for you.

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:09.008
Otherwise, you can find out more

00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:13.006
about the various Office packages at microsoft365.com.
