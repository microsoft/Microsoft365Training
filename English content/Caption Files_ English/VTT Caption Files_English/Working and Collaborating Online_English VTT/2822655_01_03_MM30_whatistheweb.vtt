- [Instructor] The World Wide Web,

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:03.009
also known as the web for short,

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.005
is a system that allows us to find information,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.006
publish content, and get things done using the internet.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.000
The documents on the web are called web pages,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.007
which usually display information

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:18.001
and provide clickable links to other related web pages.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:20.008
Web pages have gotten more and more interactive and robust,

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.007
and they exist for a wide variety of uses.

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.007
You can visit shopping websites to purchase goods online,

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:28.009
airline websites to book flights,

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.007
or the social media pages of your friends and relatives

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.009
to keep up with what they're doing.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.000
Every webpage has an address on the internet called a URL,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which stands for a uniform resource locator.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.003
To view a webpage, you type its URL into a software tool

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.001
called a web browser.

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.001
Typing an address into a web browser

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.000
is similar to dialing a phone number on a phone.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.008
Just like how dialing a phone number connects you

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.000
to a specific phone, typing a URL connects you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.002
to the location that webpage is stored, called a web server,

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.003
which loads the web pages onto our screens,

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.000
so we can read and interact with them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.002
So by using the web,

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.002
we can access almost any type of information

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:08.003
from anywhere with an internet connection.
