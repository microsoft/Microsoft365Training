00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Search engines are designed to provide you

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.006
with the best results that are most likely relevant

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.007
to your search word or phrase.

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.001
They can't always accurately predict

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.002
what you're looking for but there are some techniques

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.005
you can use to make it more likely you'll find what you need

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.006
in the search results.

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.008
I'm using the Bing search engine, which is the default

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.003
search engine here in Microsoft Edge but these rules apply

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.005
for nearly all search engines.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.008
First of all, there's no need to enter long sentences

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:25.006
or phrases for your search.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.006
So don't type something like how do I bake a chocolate cake.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.005
instead, just type chocolate cake.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.007
And as you can see, those two words give me results

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.009
for different recipes, photos of cakes, video lessons

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.006
on how to bake chocolate cakes, and so on.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.001
For many types of searches, Bing and other search engines

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.004
will offer search suggestions that can help you get

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.005
to popular results more quickly.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.003
So for example, I want to find out what the weather

00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.006
in San Francisco is like right now.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.009
So I'll come back up to the address bar

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.001
and start typing San Francisco.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.007
And as I type, several search suggestions appear

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.002
below the search field.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.001
If you see the search term you want to use,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.008
instead of typing out the rest of it,

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.004
just use your mouse to click the suggestion.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.007
And that quickly shows me the forecast for San Francisco

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.004
as the top search result.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:09.009
Let's look at another example.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm looking for a song I heard but I only remember

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.008
a small portion of the lyrics.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.003
I'll type those lyrics, plans get in the way,

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.002
followed by the word lyrics.

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.005
To narrow down the results, I'll put quotes

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:27.005
around the lyrics, followed by lyrics again.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.007
And that will find me lyrics that only have those words

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.004
in that order.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:34.000
And in the results, I can see that that phrase is in bold

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.002
for each link, letting me quickly read through to see

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.008
if I recognize the song I'm looking for.

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:40.001
You can also take advantage of Bing's

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
search engine smart features.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.008
For example, I'll type square root of 144.

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.001
And that not only gives me the correct answer

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.003
but this is actually a real working calculator.

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:56.005
So I can perform other calculations right from here.

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.003
And below that, I can find other search results

00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.002
related to my original search about square roots.

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.001
Another smart feature is the language translation.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:09.003
I can type something like say hello in French.

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.006
And the first result gives me a direct translation.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.000
And like the calculator, this is a live tool.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.005
So I can type in other words and select

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:20.004
other languages to translate.

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.007
Or maybe I want to see how to say that in German.

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:24.008
And there it is.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:27.000
So there you have several tips for getting more effective

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.006
and useful results from your searches more quickly.
