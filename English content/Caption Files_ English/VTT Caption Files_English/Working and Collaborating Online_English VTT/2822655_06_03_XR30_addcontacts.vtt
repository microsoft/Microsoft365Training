- [Instructor] To be able to easily communicate

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.008
with the people you message and call the most through Skype,

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.002
you'll need to add them as contacts.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.004
By adding someone as a contact,

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.002
you can quickly see whether they're currently online.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.009
And if so, you can get in touch with them

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.005
through text messages or calls with just a couple of clicks.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.005
To add a contact, click in the search bar

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:19.009
and start typing the person's name.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.004
(keyboard clacking)

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.004
If they have a Skype account, they should show up

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:26.001
in the list of results here in the Skype directory.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.005
Once you've located them, you can right click their name

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.003
and choose to add them as a contact.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.005
Now, if I clear the search,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:33.009
you can see with contacts selected,

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.000
Oliver has been added to my contacts.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.004
Now you can also search for people by their usernames,

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.003
which can be useful if the person you're searching for

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.000
has a common name, in which case,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.004
you might see multiple results

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.000
when you search for them by name.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.002
In those cases, you might want to ask your friend or colleague

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:48.009
what their Skype username is.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.000
Then you can just type that username into the search field.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.001
(keys clacking)

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.002
And then you can add them as a contact when they show up.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.008
So that's how to add contacts to your Skype account.
