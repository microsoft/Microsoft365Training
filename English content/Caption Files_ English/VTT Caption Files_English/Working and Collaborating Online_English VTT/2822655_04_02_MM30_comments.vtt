00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] When working on a document with your team,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.000
you don't have to call a meeting every time

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.006
you need to share notes or comments with each other.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.008
With Microsoft Word, you and your team members

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.005
can add comments directly to the document

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.005
for everyone to see and review.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:14.002
This allows everyone to share feedback

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.007
and collaborate in one place, the document itself.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.006
To make a comment, place your cursor at the location

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.009
in the document where you want the comment to appear.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.001
For example, I'll place my cursor

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.006
next to this logo at the top of the page.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:27.009
Then I'll go to the Review tab of the ribbon.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.003
And from here, I'll click New Comment.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.003
You can see it draws a line from where my cursor was

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:37.000
over here to the side, and I can type my comment.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.005
So it's that easy.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.007
You can also highlight specific words or phrases

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.005
to apply your comments to so it's clear

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.000
what you're commenting on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.003
For example, I noticed that the name of the hotel founder

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.009
is misspelled a few times in this document.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.009
So I'll highlight one of those misspellings,

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.007
and this time, I'll right-click on that

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.003
and choose New Comment.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.005
And now I can type my comment just like before.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.003
You can also read and respond to comments left by others.

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:01.006
If I scroll down a bit,

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.009
notice here we have a comment left by Jake.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.009
When I roll over it, I can click Reply

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.008
and start a conversation thread on this particular comment.

00:01:09.008 --> 00:01:12.007
You can also click Resolve when an issue has been addressed.

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:13.007
That grays out the comment

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:15.006
so others can see that it's been handled.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:17.005
But they can still read and review the comment thread

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:18.006
if they need to.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.001
If you want to remove a comment entirely

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.001
from the document, you can use the Delete button

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.009
here in the Review tab.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.003
If you want to hide comments from view

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.005
without deleting them,

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:29.002
toggle them with the Show Comments button.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:30.009
You can see that hides all of my comments,

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.009
and now I just see these little comment icons

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.001
indicating where they are in the document.

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.008
I can click on them to read them.

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:40.003
And if I want to see them again,

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.002
I can just click Show Comments.

00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:43.004
So as you can see,

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.005
comments are a useful tool for collaborating

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.009
and sharing feedback on a document with others.
