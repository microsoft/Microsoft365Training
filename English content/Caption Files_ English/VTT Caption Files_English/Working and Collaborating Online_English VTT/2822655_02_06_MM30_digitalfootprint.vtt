00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] If you use the internet,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.006
you should be aware of your digital footprint.

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.009
Just like physical footprints on a dirt path

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.008
that show where someone has been walking,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.006
your digital footprint is the history

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.007
of all of your online activity.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.008
Any social media posts you make, any websites you visit,

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.008
and any information you share online

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.003
contributes to your digital footprint.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.005
Now, your digital footprint isn't a single item,

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.003
it's more of the impression and profile

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:25.005
that people can build about you

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.006
by viewing and following what you've done online

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.001
across various websites and other online services.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.000
The thing to keep in mind

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.009
is that once you post something online,

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.005
you have no guarantee that it can be erased.

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:38.000
If you post something on social media

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.007
and then delete it from your account,

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.005
other people may have already seen it,

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:43.008
or they might have taken a screenshot of it.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.002
So the posts and activity

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.005
that contribute to your digital footprint can last forever.

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.007
Now, this can be a good thing if your digital footprint

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.005
includes things that give you a positive reputation online

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.002
and help you build your personal brand.

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.004
Your online history can also help the apps you use

00:00:58.004 --> 00:00:59.009
to know more about you.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.009
They can use this information to serve you better

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.001
by adjusting to the things you like and your daily habits.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.002
But they can also use this information in the wrong way

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.001
and share it with others.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.002
Keep the following tips in mind when you go online

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.004
to manage your digital footprint.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.000
First, know what your footprint says about you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.003
People who search for you online

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.009
will make judgements about you based on what they find.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.004
This can include employers when you apply for a job,

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:26.000
or recruiters when you apply for academic programs.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.008
It's important to know

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.003
what your digital footprint says about you

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.000
and how your information is being used.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.008
To see what your personal brand is online,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.007
you can search for yourself.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.002
Search for your name in a search engine

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.004
and see what results are displayed.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.008
If these results don't show you what you want,

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.003
think about what you share online

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.002
and what information you allow other people to see.

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:48.004
Secondly, actively manage your privacy settings.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.000
You can modify the privacy settings

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.005
of most of the social media sites

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:53.006
and online applications you use.

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.008
This can help you control who sees what you share

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.001
and what information shows up

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.008
when someone searches for you online.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:01.008
Third, manage your cookies.

00:02:01.008 --> 00:02:03.008
Cookies are notes given to your web browser

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.002
as you browse the web.

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.005
These cookies help apps track information that they need

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.001
while you're using the app.

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:11.002
This can help the app work better for you.

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.008
But this data also contributes to your digital footprint

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.007
as it allows other sites to gain information

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:18.005
about the sites you visit and your interests.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.001
You can use the settings in your web browser

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.006
to limit or block the use of cookies on certain websites.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.002
And fourth, think before you share.

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:28.001
Behave like once you share something online,

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.006
you can't take it back, because that's often the case.

00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:32.008
Make sure you're okay with something

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:35.006
being part of your public persona before you share it

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:39.001
because your digital footprint can live indefinitely online.

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.001
So keep these tips in mind to make sure you're happy

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.004
with your digital footprint and how it's used.
