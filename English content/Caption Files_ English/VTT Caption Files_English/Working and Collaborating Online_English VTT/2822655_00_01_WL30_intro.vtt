- Computers keep us in touch with family and friends,

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.005
and help us do our jobs.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.002
The connectedness of our devices allows us to achieve more.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.007
And the internet allows you to tap into people

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.005
and great ideas around the world

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:17.002
to collaborate with anyone and bring your ambitions to life.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.006
This series of lessons is designed to help you improve

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.005
your current skills and also learn new skills

You might be new to working online,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:35.003
or you may have a lot of experience online with smartphones,

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.007
but you're learning how to accomplish tasks on laptops

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:39.006
or desktop computers.

If the thought of working online seems intimidating to you,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.000
or if you have felt frustrated with previous attempts

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.001
to learn these skills,

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.005
consider this insight from a talented

digital literacy coach in Kenya, Grace Nshimiyumukiza.

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:54.008
She noted that the roots of getting to knowledge

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.006
are always hard and tough,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.009
but the fruits of it are always enjoyable and sweet.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:04.006
So practice these skills and over time you will succeed.

use email, video chat, and search the internet,

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.004
as well as how to stay safe while doing so.
