00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Most email programs

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.008
let you create and save the contact information

00:00:03.008 --> 00:00:05.009
of the people you communicate with.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.001
This makes it easy to not only send emails to them

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.005
without having to look up their information each time,

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.004
but you can also save

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.003
other important information about your contacts

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:16.008
that can easily be looked up or referenced at any time.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.006
A contact can be as basic as a name and email address

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.009
or include information like a street address,

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.009
multiple phone numbers, a photo,

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.002
or any other relevant notes.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:27.006
Here in Microsoft Outlook,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.004
you can add contacts in a couple of different ways.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.003
If you received an email message from someone

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.000
and you want to add them to your contacts,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.003
right-click on their email address

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.002
and choose Add to Outlook Contacts.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.002
In the window that opens, you'll see any details

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.000
that Outlook was able to pull from the email

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.003
already filled in here.

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.002
So we have the full name and email address.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.003
If you have any other info you can fill in other fields,

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:52.005
like the company this person works for, their title,

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.003
a web page associated with them, phone numbers,

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.003
and if you have a photo of them,

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.004
you can add it by clicking this icon here.

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:00.008
You can also use this Notes area

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.009
for any other info you may want to remember,

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:06.003
for example, their birthday or the name of their spouse.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.001
When you're done, click Save &amp; Close.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.000
And the next time

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.005
you want to send an email to this contact,

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.005
just click New Email, start typing their name,

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:15.005
and you'll be able to select them

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.006
from Outlook's suggestions.

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.003
I'll just close this for now.

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.004
Now you can also add contacts from scratch,

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:24.007
for example, if someone gives you their business card

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.008
and you want to file their contact info in Outlook.

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.004
Just click the People icon here at the bottom of the window

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:33.002
and this is where you'll find your existing contacts.

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:35.009
Click the New Contact button here at the top,

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.005
and from here enter any relevant information.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:44.000
So I can type in Jess' name, her job title,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.007
her email address.

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.001
If I have a photo of her, I can click the photo,

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.008
and there's her headshot so I'll select that.

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.006
And I can even add some notes.

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:57.009
And, again, when I'm done, I can click Save &amp; Close.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.007
And the next time I need to send an email to Jess,

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.005
I can just click New Email, start typing her name,

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:03.008
there she is,

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.008
and the To field is now filled out.

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:08.006
So that's how to add contacts to your Microsoft Outlook.
