00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] OneDrive is a useful resource

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.009
for storing files that you want to share

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.008
or distribute to others.

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:07.007
Even with the default amount of storage space

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:09.005
you get with a free OneDrive account,

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.003
you can share much larger files than you could

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:13.006
by sending them over e-mail.

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.006
Sharing a file with others from OneDrive

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.003
is a simple matter of generating a link

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.001
that you can send to them.

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.008
Start by selecting the file you want to share

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:22.006
from your file list,

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.003
then in the toolbar, click the Share button.

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.001
In this Send link area that opens,

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.006
you can enter the e-mail addresses

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.007
of the people you want to share the file with,

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.008
to have Microsoft automatically send an e-mail

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:35.002
with a link to that file when you click Send.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.008
Alternately, you can generate a link by clicking Copy Link,

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.009
and that creates a link you can copy it to your clipboard

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.008
by clicking Copy.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.004
And then you're free to paste that address

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.004
into an e-mail you're composing yourself

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.004
or into an instant messaging program

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.006
or a webpage you're publishing, and so on.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:52.003
For example, I've already started composing

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:56.003
an e-mail message in Microsoft Outlook,

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:59.009
and here I'll just right click and choose Paste

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.003
to paste in that address.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:02.009
And once I'm done, I can click Send

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:04.007
to send the e-mail containing this link,

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:07.002
and my recipient will be able to click that link

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.005
to download the file to her own computer.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.008
So that's a look at how easy it is

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.004
to share files from OneDrive.
