00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- Before you start using Skype to make calls

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.005
you should make sure your audio and video settings are

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.004
configured properly so others can hear or see you.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.007
You should always confirm your settings before making or

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:10.009
receiving a call.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.006
You don't want to be fumbling around with your settings

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:13.005
during a call,

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.009
especially if it's an important or professional call.

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.000
Here in Skype, start by clicking this three dot button

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.007
and selecting settings, and then select audio and video.

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.008
And here at the top next to camera,

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.000
if you have multiple cameras connected to your computer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.002
you can choose the one you want to use in Skype.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.003
I'm using a surface tablet.

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.000
So I have both a front facing camera and a rear facing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.007
camera, but for Skype calls,

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:41.000
I most likely want to keep my front facing camera selected.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.001
Once you've selected your camera,

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.009
you can scroll down to your audio settings.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.004
Here next to microphone,

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.007
you can choose the microphone you want to use.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.000
This might be your computer's default built in microphone,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.005
or you may have connected a USB microphone,

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.001
or you might want to use a microphone built into an external

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:56.009
webcam you've connected to your computer.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.004
Notice as I'm speaking, we're seeing this meter move,

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.007
and this is telling me the audio levels that are going into

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.003
the microphone and Skype is actually doing a pretty good job

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.002
of keeping those levels even.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.001
If you want,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.009
you can turn this automatically adjust microphone settings

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.006
switch off and manually adjust your microphone settings.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:15.006
Basically, you don't want the levels getting all the way

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:16.004
to the right here.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.009
I'm just going to leave it set to auto in this case.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.005
Below that you can choose the speakers you want

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.003
to use to listen to audio through Skype.

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.003
This could be your devices built in speakers,

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.004
external speakers, a Bluetooth headset

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.007
you've paired to your computer, and so on.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.003
By clicking the test audio button,

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:33.006
you can check if the audio is playing

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.005
through your selected speakers.

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:38.003
(computer dinging)

00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:40.000
Now, if you don't hear anything,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.007
double check to make sure you have the right speakers

00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.004
selected and then on your speakers or headset themselves,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:48.000
make sure they're turned on and not muted.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.006
You can close settings,

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:51.009
and once you have your video and audio settings configured,

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.004
you're ready to make a call.

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.003
Let's try a video call.

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:56.003
I'll come over here to my contacts,

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.009
and I want to get my friend Nick a call.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.006
So I'll select his name

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:02.002
and here in the upper right hand corner,

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.008
I could click the phone button to make an audio call over

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.002
Skype, but in this case,

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:11.003
I'll click the video camera icon to make a video call.

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.009
And I could see myself as a call is being placed.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.006
And in a second, there's Nick, Hey Nick.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:19.005
- Hello.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.005
- Thanks for helping me out with this.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.006
- No problem.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.008
- So that's pretty much all there is

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.007
to making a video call and Skype.

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.007
We can now both see and hear each other,

00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:29.002
and we can have a conversation and Skype, anytime we like,

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.005
as long as we both someplace with an internet connection.

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:33.006
So at this point,

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.008
I want to show what it looks like if we receive a video

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.001
call, so Nick, I'm going to hang up,

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.000
but could you call me back in just a couple seconds?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.009
- No problem.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:41.007
- Alright.

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:43.003
See in a second.

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:44.007
All right, so to receive a call,

00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:46.000
Skype needs to be running

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.001
and now we can see Nick is calling.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.008
Now I could click the phone button if I only wanted to

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:54.000
answer with audio or I can hang up if I didn't want to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.002
answer it all.

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:59.004
But in this case, I will answer with the video button again.

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:00.004
And once again, there's Nick.

00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:01.004
Hello again.

00:03:01.004 --> 00:03:02.002
- Hey.

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:03.002
- So that's pretty much it.

00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:04.009
We can now just continue having our normal conversation

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.000
here over video.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.009
All right, so thanks again, Nick.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.008
- No problem.

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:12.003
- All right, we'll talk to you later.

00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:13.009
Okay, so that's how you set up your audio

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:14.008
and video settings.

00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:17.002
So you can make and receive calls in Skype.
