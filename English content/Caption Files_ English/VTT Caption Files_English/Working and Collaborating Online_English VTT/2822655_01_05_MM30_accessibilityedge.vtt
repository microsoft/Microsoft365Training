00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] An important aspect of the web

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.004
is that the information found there should be available

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.008
and accessible to everyone equally.

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.009
That's why both modern websites and modern web browsers

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.008
include accessibility features and options to help people

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.000
browse the web in the way that best suits their needs.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.006
For example, the Microsoft Edge browser includes options

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.005
to assist people who may have vision or motor impairments

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.009
better navigate the web pages they visit.

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.004
You can zoom into a webpage by pressing the Control button

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.009
and the plus sign on your keyboard.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.001
And that can make it easier to read the text and to see

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.007
the images on the page.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.007
Similarly, pressing Control and the minus key

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.002
lets you zoom out, which can make it easier to get

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.007
a view of the entire page and orient yourself to its layout.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.006
Alternately, if you have trouble pressing multiple keys

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:45.006
at the same time to use the zoom feature,

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.006
you can also hold the Control key with one hand

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.003
and turn the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out.

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.006
And pressing Control-zero resets the page back

00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.002
to its default size.

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:55.007
Another option for reading web pages

00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.008
is the Immersive Reader feature.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.008
This is only available or partially available

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.006
on some webpages.

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.004
If it's available on the page you're viewing,

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.008
you'll find the Immersive Reader button here

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:07.005
in the address bar of Edge.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.009
And as you can see, that displays the text on the page

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.000
at a larger size and in a cleaner layout

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.008
with fewer distractions.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.006
At the top of the screen, you can click on Text preferences

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:18.004
to adjust how the text is displayed and the color

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.001
of the background it appears on.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.007
So I can make the text larger and maybe change it

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.006
to white on black.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.007
For some people, higher contrast themes like this

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.008
make it easier to read text.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.004
I'll close the Immersive Reader view by clicking

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.006
its button again.

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.005
You can even have Edge read web pages aloud to you.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.001
This can be useful if you have difficulty reading

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:38.005
long passages of text, for example.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.006
Just right-click on the text you want to have read to you

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.005
and choose Read aloud and Edge will read and highlight

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.007
the words as it speaks them.

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:48.001
- [Edge] As people continue to turn to online learning

00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.006
to adapt, many people are investing

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:53.004
in this highly strategic skill.

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.000
While all levels within the organization.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.005
- [Instructor] And I can pause that with the controls

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.009
at the top of the screen.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.004
You can also click voice options to adjust the speed

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.001
it reads to you and the voice it uses.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.003
And for users who may have difficulty using a mouse

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.006
when browsing, Edge includes several keyboard shortcuts.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.007
Press F6 on the keyboard to cycle through the elements

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.007
of the browser like the tab bar, the address bar,

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.002
the content of the web page, and so on.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.006
So for example, I have two other tabs open.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:22.002
So I can press F6 until I see the first tab highlight.

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:25.001
And then use the arrow keys on my keyboard to navigate

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:28.002
to the tab I want to view.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.006
And press Enter to bring it to the front.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:34.004
Or I can press F6 until the address bar is highlighted

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.006
so I can type in the address of the website I want to visit.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.004
Pressing the Tab key lets you move forward

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:41.002
through the elements on the page.

00:02:41.002 --> 00:02:43.003
That includes links, text fields on forms,

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:44.006
and the address bar.

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.005
And Shift-Tab lets you move backwards.

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:49.009
And pressing Shift-F10 is like right-clicking

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.001
on a selected element.

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.006
These are just a few examples of the accessibility features

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.004
built into Microsoft Edge that make it easier for everyone

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.005
to browse and interact with webpages.
