00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.005
- Digital calendar applications

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:04.005
are a great way to keep track of meetings

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:08.000
and tasks on your own or with the people you work with.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.009
Unlike traditional paper calendars or date books,

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.008
digital calendar software makes it easy

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.002
to keep your schedule synced with other people,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.006
so if you schedule, reschedule,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.006
or cancel meetings or appointments,

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.003
everyone's calendar is updated to reflect that information.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.009
There are lots of popular calendar apps

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.008
used across multiple platforms, including Google Calendar,

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:31.007
Apple Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook.

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.000
In this chapter, we'll be focusing on Outlook

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.007
because in addition to it being

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:37.009
a professional calendar application,

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.001
it's also a full fledged email application

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:42.006
and contact manager, so you can easily keep

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:44.008
your appointments and other tasks synced between

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.000
yourself and others in one place.
