WEBVTT

00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] On your computer, your web browser

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.002
is the software you need in order to access

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.003
and interact with the content on the web.

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.002
Most operating systems come with at least one

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.002
built in web browser application.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.004
For example, Mac OS computers include the Safari browser

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.009
and Windows 10 includes Microsoft Edge

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.000
but there are several other browsers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.006
on the market to choose from including Google Chrome

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.008
and Mozilla Firefox.

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.006
At the most basic level, all browsers allow you to access

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.006
websites, download files, images, and videos

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.008
on websites and so on.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.009
Browsers mainly vary in the features they include

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.001
but these days most browsers have very similar features.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.005
Here we'll take a look at browsing the web

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:39.006
with Microsoft Edge, but you'll be able to use

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.005
other modern browsers in mostly the same away.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.006
I'll open up Microsoft Edge and there it is.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.006
To access a website, we enter the URL or address

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.000
of the site into the address bar at the top of the window.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.009
The browser loads the webpage and it's displayed

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.005
in the main part of the window.

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.004
We can use the scroll bar to scroll down the page

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.002
to view it and to interact with all the elements

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.009
on the page.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.008
White pages usually contain hyperlinks,

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.004
often just called links, that point to other pages

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.008
on the website or to entirely different websites.

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:10.006
You can often tell if text is a hyperlink

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:11.008
by its appearance.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.009
It's usually a different color from the surrounding text

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.005
like we see here, or it becomes underlined or already

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:18.009
is underlined, or it's just visually different

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.003
in some other way.

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.002
Alternately, if you place your mouse over text

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.003
or an image and the cursor turns into a hand

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.000
with a pointing finger, that indicates

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the item is a clickable link.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.007
You'll also see the address that clicking the link

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.002
will take you to there in the lower left hand corner

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:35.001
and if I click that link I'll go to that page.

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:36.007
And now we're looking at the webpage that was linked

00:01:36.007 --> 00:01:40.002
from the previous page and we can start browsing this page.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.003
If necessary, you can go back to the previous page

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.002
by clicking the back button in the browser.

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:46.008
Similarly, you can click the forward button

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.009
to view that link page again.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.003
Although it's easy to move back and forth

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:52.004
between pages like this, there are often times

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.003
when you need to reference multiple webpages

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:57.008
at the same time and going back and forth can get tedious.

00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.004
A solution is to use tabs which are a feature

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.004
of web browsers which allow you to open multiple

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.006
webpages at the same time in the same browser window.

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:07.008
For example, maybe I'm searching for Microsoft Surface

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.005
tablets, I'll click that link, and as you can see

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:14.004
there are many different models to choose from here.

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.002
Clicking one of these takes me to the page

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.008
about that model and then I need to click the back button

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:22.008
to go back to the links to look at the other models.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.009
To save time, I'm going to right click on the link

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:28.004
and choose open link in new tab.

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.003
In this particular browser, that opens a new tab

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:31.007
here in the background and you can see

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.004
the title of the page here.

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:35.003
In some web browsers, depending on your settings,

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:38.003
the new tab may open in the front, but in either case

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:39.009
you can switch back and forth between tabs

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.008
just by clicking on them.

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:43.007
So now I can right click on the links for the other

00:02:43.007 --> 00:02:45.005
product versions I'm interested in

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:51.002
and open them in new tabs as well.

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:52.009
And once I've done that I can now switch among

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:57.004
all the tabs to do my research.

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.002
You can also open the web pages in new windows

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:03.004
by right clicking and choosing open link in new window.

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:05.007
Opening links in new windows can help you stay organized

00:03:05.007 --> 00:03:07.008
by grouping related tabs in their own window

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.004
and opening unrelated tabs in other windows,

00:03:10.004 --> 00:03:12.006
but that's a matter of personal preference.

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:14.002
But because these are separate windows, I can move

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:15.007
this one slightly out of the way and still see

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.008
the other window here in the background

00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:20.003
and I can switch to that if I needed to.

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.001
You can always keep track of the web pages you visit

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.003
by using the history feature of the browser.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.001
In Edge, click the three dot button here

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:27.009
in the upper right hand corner

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.002
and roll your mouse over history

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:32.005
and from here I can choose manage history

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:34.006
to see a list of the web pages I visited,

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.002
organized by date.

00:03:36.002 --> 00:03:38.001
You have the option to clear web pages from your history

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:39.009
whenever you like, which you can do by clicking

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.005
clear browsing data and here I can choose

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:45.001
to clear the browsing history from the last 24 hours,

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:47.009
the last hour, the last seven days, the last four weeks

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.000
and all of my browsing history.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.004
I'll leave that as is for now though.

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.001
Again, you'll find all the features we've seen here

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.004
in Microsoft Edge in other browsers as well,

00:03:56.004 --> 00:03:59.000
but they may be located in different places.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.007
But once you familiarize yourself with your preferred

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:03.004
browser, you'll find these features make it easy

00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:04.004
to browse the web.
