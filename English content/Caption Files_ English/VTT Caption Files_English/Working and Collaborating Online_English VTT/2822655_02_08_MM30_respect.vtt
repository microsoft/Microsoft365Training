00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Narrator] The internet and social media platforms

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.001
allow us to connect with our friends, family,

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.006
and peers in a variety of ways.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.001
It's a great way to keep in touch,

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.006
but sometimes people take advantage of these platforms

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.000
and use them to spread negative messages about others.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.004
Cyberbullying or bullying that takes place on the internet

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:21.002
can be just as bad as bullying in person.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.004
People can use the internet to send hurtful messages

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:25.006
to someone, spread fake rumors

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:29.000
or share someone's private information without permission.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.004
The results of cyberbullying can be just as impacting

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.007
as face to face bullying.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.000
When someone is cyberbullied,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.006
their feelings can be hurt

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.000
and their reputation can be damaged.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You can't always prevent cyberbullying,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.005
but you can play a part in making the internet a friendlier

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.008
and safer place for everyone.

00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:47.005
Here's some guidelines you can follow

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.000
to promote civility online.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.007
First, simply avoid sending negative messages

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.009
and participating in behavior that can hurt someone else.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.002
Respect differences.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.000
When you interact with people online,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.005
respect their differences in opinion, experience

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.008
and culture.

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.002
Even if you don't agree with something

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.000
that another person shares online,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.008
you should still treat them with respect

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.004
and make the internet a friendly place

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.009
for communication and discussion.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.001
Think about the consequences of sharing.

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.003
Before you share or post anything online,

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.008
always pause and think about the consequences of doing so.

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.007
Will your message hurts someone else?

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:23.008
Will it damage your reputation or the safety

00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:25.009
or reputation of others?

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.005
Does it contribute anything constructive

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.003
to the conversation?

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:31.000
If you feel unsafe online,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.007
you should feel comfortable to remove yourself

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.007
from a situation and report it to someone you trust.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.004
There is no rule requiring you to engage in conversations

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.007
or arguments with people online.

00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:43.008
And when you do see cruel or dangerous activity online,

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.004
offer to support those involved

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.004
and report the incident to someone you trust.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.003
We can all play a part in being responsible,

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.002
digital citizens online in making the internet a safe

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:55.000
and friendly place for everyone.
