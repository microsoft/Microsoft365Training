00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] A big part of being connected to the internet

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.001
is having access to the seemingly unlimited amounts

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.008
of information out there.

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:07.009
As you may know,

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.009
the best way to find information you're looking for

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.009
is to perform a search through a search engine.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.001
A search engine is an online resource

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.009
that systematically catalogs the contents of the web

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.006
so that when you perform a search,

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.000
you can bring up webpages matching the words or terms

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.007
you're looking for.

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:25.003
There are many search engines out there,

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.003
and you've probably heard of at least a few of them,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:32.001
like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft Bing, or DuckDuckGo.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.005
Searching is such an integral part

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.008
of being on the web that all modern web browsers

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.000
have web searching built in.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.007
For example, to perform a search,

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:43.004
I could go to bing.com

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.003
here in my Microsoft Edge browser,

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.007
and I could type the term I'm searching for

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.003
in the search field here.

00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.007
But Bing is also the default search engine in Edge,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.003
and almost all browsers allow you to set

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.005
the default search engine you want to use.

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:55.003
So for example,

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.004
if I wanted to search for information

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.003
about Yosemite National Park,

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:00.002
I can type that right into the address bar,

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:03.000
regardless of whether I'm on bing.com or not.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.008
Notice as I type,

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.007
suggestions to complete my search term start appearing.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:07.008
If I see the one I want,

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.003
I can just click it.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.006
Otherwise I could have kept typing

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.002
and pressed enter to search.

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.008
And now I'm looking at my search results on Bing.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.001
Each search result is a link that will take me to the page

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.004
or website that Bing has found.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:20.003
To help me determine

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.006
if the page includes the information I'm looking for,

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.000
most of the results also have a few excerpts of text

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.005
from those pages and some images.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.003
For example, here's the Wikipedia page

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:30.008
for Yosemite National Park,

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:32.008
which I might want to read to learn a little bit more

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.007
about the history of the park.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.001
So clicking that link takes me to the website,

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.005
and as you can see in the address bar,

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:40.006
I'm now viewing Wikipedia.

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:42.000
If this isn't what I was looking for,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.004
or if I just want to browse other pages Bing found,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.001
I can click the back button

00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.002
to go back to the previous page of results.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:50.008
Notice that in addition to web pages,

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.008
there's plenty of information here too.

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.008
I can click about and see a summary about the park,

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.006
I can get directions from my current location

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.001
to Yosemite, and I can visit the official website

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.009
using the website button here.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.001
And as you saw when I scrolled down,

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.001
we can find news and photos related to Yosemite.

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:06.009
If I scroll back up,

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.001
I'll find categories that allow me to narrow my search

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:14.003
to just images of Yosemite or videos of Yosemite,

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:17.002
as well as maps, news, and even shopping pages

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.001
where I could find products related to Yosemite

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:20.007
that I can purchase.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.005
Let's say I'm looking for photos right now.

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:24.004
I'll click images.

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.009
And just like that, I see the results.

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.004
As I roll over each image,

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.009
I see information about the source of the images.

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.008
Many of these appear to be from articles about Yosemite.

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.008
And clicking an image allows me to see it at a larger size,

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.004
and I can click the arrows here

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:43.000
to browse through my results this way.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll click the X button here

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.003
to see the smaller images again.

00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:48.000
Notice at the top of the image results,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.003
we see a row of suggestions that may help you narrow down

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.003
the type of image you're searching for.

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:53.003
So maybe instead of searching

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:55.002
for general photos of Yosemite,

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:58.003
I want to search for photos of winter in the park.

00:02:58.003 --> 00:02:59.008
And there we are.

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:00.009
So this has been a quick look

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.005
at how most modern search engines make it easier to find

00:03:03.005 --> 00:03:05.000
the information and other content

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.005
you're looking for on the web.
