00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Presenter] The internet allows us to communicate

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:05.000
with other people in lots of different ways.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.003
However, it isn't always safe

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.005
to communicate with other people online.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.005
You don't always know for sure who you're talking to

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.008
when you're on the internet,

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.005
and every day online predators

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.005
pretend to be people they aren't.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.004
Here are some tips you can use to keep yourself safer

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.000
when communicating online.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.001
First, listen to your instincts.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.006
If someone makes you feel nervous or uncomfortable

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.002
by asking probing questions

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:28.002
or trying to get information out of you,

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.007
stop communicating with them right away.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.003
Most websites and social media sites have tools

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.006
that you can use to report suspicious activity.

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.008
Second, limit what you share.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.006
Online predators often try to get you

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.008
to share personal information through emails

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.008
or other messaging services.

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:46.006
Just like you wouldn't share personal information

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.001
with a stranger on the street,

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.005
don't share information with strangers online, either.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:53.008
And third, keep your distance.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:55.006
Think twice about meeting someone in person

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.008
that you have only talked to online.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.008
Online predators often use social media

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.002
to pretend to be someone else

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.007
by setting up fake profiles using other people's pictures.

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.003
Even if someone seems friendly,

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:08.007
it can be difficult to know for sure who they really are

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.000
when you're just talking online.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.004
Always tell someone you trust

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.008
when an online stranger asks to meet you in person,

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.000
so you don't end up in a dangerous situation.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.005
Keep these risks and tips in mind so you can stay safe

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.001
when you talk to people online.
