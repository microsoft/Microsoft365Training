00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Microsoft Word's ability

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.004
to track changes allows you to freely make edits

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.000
to a document and your collaborators will be able to see

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
exactly what changes you made.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.009
Start by going to the Review tab

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.002
and here click Track Changes.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.004
With that enabled, Word will track any changes

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:17.009
you or anyone else makes to the document.

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.005
So for example, I might highlight some text here

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.000
and make that bold.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.001
I see a misspelling down here, which I'll fix,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.004
changing that A to an O.

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.008
And maybe down here I will create a new paragraph.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.001
To review changes made to the document,

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.005
you can come back to the Review tab

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.006
and notice here we have this menu

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.000
that's currently set to Simple Markup.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.007
We have several options here.

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.003
The Simple Markup option indicates

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:44.000
where changes have been made with a red line in the margin.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.001
So you might've noticed that as I made my changes,

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.009
these red lines appeared.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:52.006
All Markup shows the edits with a blue highlight,

00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:55.003
and you can actually see the changes here in the document.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.006
Now, in this first case at the top,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:58.000
you can see that the change

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.001
is that the font was changed to bold.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.001
Down here you can see that the A was deleted

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.005
and the O was typed in its place.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:06.007
And here we can see another line

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.000
indicating a paragraph break.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There's also the option here of No Markup,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.005
which hides all the markups

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.009
and shows you what the changes will look like

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.009
in the document.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.000
And Original shows the document in its original form

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.002
without the changes,

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.000
which can be useful for comparing the original

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.006
with the edited version.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:24.009
Additionally, when you're viewing an option

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.001
that displays the markups,

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.000
you can use the Show Markup menu here

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to specify which types of revisions you want to see.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.008
So for example,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:34.007
if you only wanted to see formatting changes,

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:37.005
you could uncheck everything but that option.

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:39.003
And now you can see, I'm only seeing the change here,

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.003
where I changed this text to bold,

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.006
but if I want to see the other changes

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.008
I can add Insert and Deletions back,

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:47.005
and if I have comments, I can see those as well.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.002
So, that's how to track changes to documents in Word.
