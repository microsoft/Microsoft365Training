00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.003
- The internet makes it possible for us to stay in touch

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.008
with our friends, family, and colleagues online.

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.007
Communication can happen in real-time

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.008
with apps and services that make it easy

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.009
to chat through instant messaging,

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
voice calling and video calls.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.009
Instant messaging is a text-based form of communication,

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.000
where you can type messages on your computer

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or mobile device to send to people

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.009
who can then instantly read and respond to your messages

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.008
on their devices.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.001
Voice calling over the internet

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.005
is similar to traditional phone calls,

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.004
only instead of using a landline or mobile phone,

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.006
you place your call over the internet using an app.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.009
And video calling is like a voice call,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.007
but where you and the people you're calling

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.003
can hear and see each other.

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.000
Which of these three forms of communication you use

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.002
depends on what you determine is appropriate at the time.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:52.005
If you just need to ask a quick question,

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.000
but don't necessarily need an immediate response,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.009
you can send an instant message.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.001
Your recipients can then respond when they have a moment.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.009
If you need a more immediate reply,

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:03.007
you can try a voice call.

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:05.006
And video-based calls can make it easier

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.007
to have certain conversations because you can see each other

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.003
and read the expressions on each caller's face.

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.004
In many cases, there are apps that allow you to use

00:01:14.004 --> 00:01:16.007
all three of these forms of communication

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:20.002
while other apps focus specifically on one or two types.

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.009
Apple FaceTime, for example,

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.001
allows you to make voice and video calls,

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.008
but you use a separate Apple app called iMessage

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:28.008
for instant messaging.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.008
Another example is WhatsApp,

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:32.008
which is an app that lets you send messages

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.002
and voice and video chat as well.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:36.006
And there's also Skype,

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:38.008
which in addition to instant messages

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:41.009
and voice and video chatting is also one of the few apps

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.009
through which you can call phone numbers,

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.007
letting you make both domestic and international calls

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.003
from your computer or mobile phone.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:51.001
In this chapter, we'll look more closely

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.008
at communicating using Skype.
