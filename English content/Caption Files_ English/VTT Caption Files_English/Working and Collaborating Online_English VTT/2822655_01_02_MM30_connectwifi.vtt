00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Wi-Fi networks allow you

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:05.000
to get online without the use of a wired ethernet connection

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.002
in places like your home or office,

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:11.000
or in hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and so on.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.001
Let's take a look at how to connect to a Wi-Fi network

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.003
on a Windows 10 computer.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.005
The first step is to check your Wi-Fi status,

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.000
which you can see in the right hand side

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.005
of the task bar at the bottom of your screen.

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:23.005
Notice this icon that looks like a globe,

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.004
which you can think of as representing the worldwide web.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.006
If I roll my mouse over that icon,

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.000
I can see a message telling me

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.001
I'm not currently connected to a network

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.006
and it says no connections are available.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.007
Now I know for a fact that there are Wi-Fi networks

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:37.008
where I am right now.

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:39.005
So this probably means that the Wi-Fi

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.003
on my computer is turned off.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.002
So I need to turn it back on.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.006
I can do that simply by clicking this icon.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:47.007
Here I'll click Wi-Fi.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.006
I've re-enabled Wi-Fi on my computer

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.001
and now I see a list of nearby Wi-Fi networks along

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.001
with their signal strength.

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.002
The more bars you see in the icon next to the network,

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.009
the stronger the connection.

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.006
Generally, the stronger the connection,

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.000
the faster and more consistent

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the Wi-Fi performance will be.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.008
So you can see,

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.008
I only have a couple bars down on this network here,

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:06.009
a few more here.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.009
But here at the top,

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.005
we see full strength Wi-Fi signals.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.003
In most cases,

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.005
you'll want to connect to a network

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.009
whose name you recognize.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.000
This might be your home or office network

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.007
or a network in the coffee shop you're sitting in.

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.006
You'll also usually see the word secured

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:22.001
under the Wi-Fi network name,

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.009
indicating that the network is password protected.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.002
You can connect to networks that are labeled open,

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.004
but they'll often be set up with other security measures

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.003
that require you to validate your identity

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:34.000
before allowing you to fully connect.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.009
As a rule of thumb,

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.006
you shouldn't connect to unknown networks

00:01:36.006 --> 00:01:37.008
as a matter of etiquette,

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.004
but also for security reasons.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.002
In this case,

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:42.009
I do know that this one in particular is a trusted network,

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.000
so I'll select it.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.005
If I want to automatically connect

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.004
to this network in the future,

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:49.007
I'll make sure connect automatically is checked.

00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:51.008
And then I'll click connect.

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:53.006
I'm prompted to enter the password.

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.001
If you're connecting to your own network,

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.007
you should know the password.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.002
If you're connecting to a Wi-Fi network

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.005
at a business or a shop,

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:01.006
you may have to ask for the password.

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:02.004
For security,

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:04.003
the password is displayed as dots.

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:05.001
But if you want,

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:06.004
you can check that you're typing it correctly

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.004
by clicking and holding on this eye icon.

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.005
When you release that button,

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.003
it'll go back to being dots.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.007
Once you enter the password, click next.

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.003
Depending on how your computer is configured,

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:19.000
you may see this message asking if you want your computer

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.005
to be seen by other computers on the network.

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:23.007
If you're connecting to your home or office network,

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:24.008
click yes.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.001
Being able to see other computers

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:27.002
on your network makes it easy

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.007
to transfer files between them.

00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:31.001
Now I see the message that I'm connected

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.004
to my Wi-Fi network.

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.000
So I can open up my internet browser

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and start visiting websites.
