00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] When logged into Skype,

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.001
you and your contacts can keep track

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.005
of each other's availability with the presence indicators.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.002
You can set your own presence status

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.007
by clicking the colored dot next to your name.

00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:11.007
Active is green

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.008
and means that you're actively using your computer

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.000
and are generally available to receive messages and calls.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.004
This doesn't mean that you have to receive

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:20.000
and reply to messages right away,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.005
but it's a good idea to set your status

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.002
to let your friends and coworkers know your availability

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.009
so they have a better idea of when they might

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.006
get a reply from you.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.002
So you can set your status to away

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.007
if you're away from your computer,

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.002
in a meeting, and so on,

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:35.001
which turns your icon yellow,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.002
and that lets your contacts know

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:37.008
that you may not respond right away,

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.007
but that you're still able to receive messages.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:41.007
And do not disturb

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.008
not only turns the presence indicator red,

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.001
but it will also mute notifications about incoming messages

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.005
so you truly won't be disturbed

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.005
by people trying to text or call you.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.003
Your contacts will still see that you're logged into Skype,

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.002
but the red indicator will let them know that you aren't

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.006
receiving notifications at the moment.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.006
And for times when you went to remain on Skype

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.001
but not show up as online,

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.005
you can choose the invisible option.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.006
I'll set mine back to active.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.005
Now, regardless of someone's presence indicator,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.004
you can send them a text message at any time

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.000
by clicking their name in your contact list

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.006
and then just start typing a message.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.002
I'll press Enter to send that message to Jade.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.003
Now, when I see Jade's icon or initials appear

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:22.006
below that message,

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.006
that tells me that she's seen the message,

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.004
and notice that when she starts replying,

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.006
we see a message here that Jade is typing.

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.006
And now I've received a reply from Jade

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:36.004
and I can again reply to her.

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.003
Now I can see that Jade has set her status to away

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.008
so I know that I might not receive a reply right away,

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:42.009
so I can just leave Skype running

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.005
to check in with my other contacts

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:46.006
or while I do other work on my computer.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:49.005
And that's how to have a text-based conversation in Skype.
