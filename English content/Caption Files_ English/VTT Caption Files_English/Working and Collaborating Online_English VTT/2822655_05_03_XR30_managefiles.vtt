00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] In the OneDrive web interface,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.007
there are three main areas for helping you

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:06.006
view, work with, and manage your files.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.001
We have the navigation pane over here on the left,

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.001
the toolbar across the top,

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.004
and the file list, which takes up

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.003
the majority of the window.

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.008
You may see slightly different views

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.003
depending if you're signed into OneDrive

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.003
with a personal, work, or student account,

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.001
but basically, you click any of the categories here

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.002
in the navigation pane to determine

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.001
what you see in the file list area.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.007
Currently, I have My files selected,

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.004
so I'm looking at all of my files.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.005
I can click Recent to see the files

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.002
I've worked with the most recently,

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:37.000
Photos to see the photo stored on my OneDrive account,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.002
and so on.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.009
Up here in the toolbar area,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.004
you can use the search field to search

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:43.009
for files on your OneDrive,

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.004
as well as create new folders or documents,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.006
or upload files from your computer to OneDrive.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.003
You can also sort files to make it easier

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.004
to locate the ones you want to work with.

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.005
For example, I may want to sort

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:58.005
by the most recently modified files.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:00:59.005
And you can change the view

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.009
of your files from this menu here.

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:08.000
I can try a compact list, tiles, or photos.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.004
To work with a file, select it in the file list area,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.003
and then, choose what you'd like

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.002
to do with it in the toolbar area.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:17.007
We can open it, share it, download it, delete it, and so on.

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.003
The toolbar also lets you check information

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.006
about your selected file by clicking this info button.

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:24.007
For example, if it's a file you have shared with

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.006
or are collaborating on with others,

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.005
you can see who has access to the file

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.009
and who last worked on it.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.004
So that's an overview of how to manage

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:33.007
your files in OneDrive.
