00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Even though it's become easier and easier

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.009
to access information and content on the web,

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.001
including everything from our favorite songs

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.009
to funny videos, to instructions on how to solve

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.002
a homework problem,

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.006
it's important to be responsible

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.005
with the information we find online.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.007
When someone posts their original work online,

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.004
they are the owner of that content

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.007
and they have certain rights, usually considered copyrights,

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:26.000
which allow them to decide how that content is used.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.003
This content includes their words,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.008
images, music, videos, and more.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.005
If it's their original content,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.006
they are the copyright owner.

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.004
So if, for example, you were putting together

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.001
a cookbook to sell online,

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.003
but you don't have the photos of food that you need,

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.001
you might think it's okay to use a search engine

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.008
to find photos to illustrate your cookbook.

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.007
But in most cases, this is not a fair or responsible way

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.008
to use the information you find online

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.008
because photos belong to the creators

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.004
and can't be used in your own work,

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.009
unless the creator specifically grants permission.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.003
If you want to use someone else's work

00:00:58.003 --> 00:00:59.006
in a product you're selling,

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.000
you should always obtain permission

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.003
from the content creator.

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:04.006
You might have to pay for a license

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.001
to use someone else's content,

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.005
or they may offer their content in exchange

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.009
for giving them credit in your work.

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.004
For example, if you use someone's photo in your cookbook,

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:14.006
you would credit the photographer

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.004
when publishing their photos in your book.

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.000
So even though you can use search engines

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.005
to easily find videos, photos, essays, and so on,

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.003
that doesn't give you permission to use them

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.000
in your own work.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.008
Make sure to do the responsible thing

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.005
and contact the content creator for permission.

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:31.009
It's the ethical thing to do,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.009
and it can also help you avoid legal troubles down the road.
