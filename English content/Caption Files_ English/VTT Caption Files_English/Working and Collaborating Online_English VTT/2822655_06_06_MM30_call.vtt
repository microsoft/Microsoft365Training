00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.002
- [Instructor] While many online communication services

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.002
allow you to make audio and video calls to other people,

00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:08.002
in most cases, the people you're calling

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.005
need to be using the same service.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:13.006
For example, in the popular WhatsApp communication tool,

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.005
you can call other WhatsApp users,

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.005
but only call other WhatsApp users.

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:19.004
Skype, on the other hand,

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.002
is one of the few communication tools

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.002
where in addition to you texting and calling

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:27.001
other Skype users, you can also call actual phone numbers.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.009
So from Skype, you can call your friends and family,

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.004
the store down the street or in another state,

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.002
or any business or person who may not have Skype,

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.002
but who does have a phone number.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.008
Now, while calls between Skype users are free,

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.005
calls from Skype to phone numbers require you to purchase

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.004
a Skype credit or a Skype subscription.

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:46.006
You can find the rates for your country

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:49.001
by going to skype.com,

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:52.007
and here clicking Skype to phone.

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.003
Then select your country,

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.003
and here you'll see the rates

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.008
for Skype credits and subscriptions.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.004
If you just want to try out calling phones

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:00.003
from Skype, though,

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.002
you can make a call up to five minutes in length for free.

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.004
Just sign into Skype and click the dial pad button.

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:17.000
Then enter the phone number you want to call.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.002
And notice it says here I can talk

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.000
for five minutes for free.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.009
I'll click the call button.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.000
- [Operator] Hi, you've reached the National Weather Service

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.008
in Oxnard, California.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:31.009
For a recording of the current weather forecast, press one.

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.002
- [Instructor] And we'll just hang up on that for now.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.006
But that's how easy it is to call a phone number from Skype.

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:41.000
Again, if this is something you think you'll frequently do,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.002
be sure to look into purchasing Skype credits

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.003
or a subscription.
