00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
- The internet offers a multitude of ways to communicate

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.008
and stay in touch with others.

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:09.004
This includes services like email, instant messaging,

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:12.002
website discussion boards, social media,

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.007
and even voice and video calls.

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.001
On top of learning how to use these various methods

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.001
of communication, it's also important

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.001
to understand when to use them.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.002
For example, if you need to ask a coworker

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:27.000
a question that requires a time sensitive reply,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.008
email might not be the best choice

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.007
as not everyone checks their email regularly

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.003
throughout the day.

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:34.009
Instead, your company may use an instant messaging service,

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.003
like Skype or Google Hangouts or Slack,

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:39.009
and sending a text-based message through that service

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.001
may get you a quicker reply.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.004
In situations where you can wait a reasonable amount of time

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.008
for a reply, email is a better choice

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:49.001
as the general expectation is that email

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.008
is not for back and forth conversation in real-time,

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.009
but instead lets each person be a little more thoughtful

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.007
about their words and the information they're sharing.

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:58.007
Email is also useful to have a written record

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:00.002
of your conversations.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.000
And of course, for real-time conversations,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.006
when you can't be in the same room,

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.008
you have the option of traditional phone calls

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:07.004
or even video-based calls,

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.006
so you can both see and hear people in real-time.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:12.007
Video calls can make it a little easier to communicate

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.002
effectively because they allow you to see the expressions

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.009
on the attendees faces during the call.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.000
So again, understanding when to use certain types

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.006
of services is an important aspect of communicating online.
