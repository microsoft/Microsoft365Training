00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
- With the way a lot of work gets done today,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.004
it's important to know how to collaborate with others

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.009
using digital tools online.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.008
With Microsoft Word, you can share your document with others

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:13.001
so they can view, comment on,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.005
or coauthor the contents with you.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.009
This allows everyone to work on the same document

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.001
instead of multiple copies of the document,

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.003
so you never have to worry about changes or edits

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:25.004
appearing in some copies, but not in others.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.008
When you share a Word document for collaboration,

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.009
everyone can work on and see changes at the same time.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.008
To share a document, open it in Word,

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.000
and then click the Share button.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.002
From here, you'll save it to your OneDrive account.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:39.007
This places the document in the cloud

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.000
so it can be easily accessed

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
by everyone who needs to work on it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.003
Next you'll determine the permissions for the file.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.005
Notice, by default it says

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.008
anyone with the link can edit this file.

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:50.005
If you need to share a document with people,

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.005
but you only want them to be able to read it,

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:55.006
you can click here and uncheck Allow Editing.

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.007
Additionally, you can set an expiration date

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.006
so the document won't be able to be accessed

00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:01.002
after the specified date,

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.005
and you can also password protect the document

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:05.003
so only people you share the password with

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.003
will be able to open the document.

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:08.009
I'm going to click Cancel for now,

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.004
because I do want to allow editing,

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.005
and I don't need to set an expiration date or password.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.009
Next you'll enter the email addresses

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.002
of the people you want to share the document with.

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.005
I'm going to share this with my colleague, Jade.

00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:22.000
Her name and email appears here, so I'll select it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.001
And you can share it with as many people as you like.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.006
And you can add a message to explain

00:01:25.006 --> 00:01:27.009
why you're sharing the document.

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.006
Then click Send.

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.000
Microsoft will send an email

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that includes a link to the document to your recipients.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.009
Let's see what this looks like

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.007
from the perspective of someone receiving the email.

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.004
I'm actually logged into Jade's email here,

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.005
and here's the email from Microsoft,

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:43.006
and here she can click Open

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:46.002
to open the document in Word Online.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.002
To edit the document, she clicks Edit Document,

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:50.000
and she'll have the choice

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.008
of editing it here in Word Online,

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:53.006
or she can use the desktop version of Word

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.004
if it's installed on her computer.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:58.002
Let's choose to edit it in Word Online.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.007
The great thing about collaborating this way

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.002
is that everyone can see the changes

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.008
everyone else is making in real time.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:08.003
So if Jade adds some text to this document,

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.009
and I switch back to my copy of the document

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.001
here in Word on my computer, I can see that change.

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.004
And I can see exactly where Jade is working on the document,

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.008
which is indicated by this colored cursor here.

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.004
If I roll my mouse over it, I can see her name.

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:21.008
This is especially useful if there are

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.007
multiple people working on the same document.

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.002
You can see where everybody is working

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.003
in that particular document at once.

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.007
Also, everyone's changes are automatically saved,

00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:31.001
so everyone else is always working on

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.006
the most up-to-date version of the document.

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.005
And that's how to share

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:36.004
and collaborate on a document in Word.
