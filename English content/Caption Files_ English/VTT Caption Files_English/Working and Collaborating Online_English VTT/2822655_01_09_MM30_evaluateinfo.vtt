00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.007
- The web is full of millions of web pages

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.007
containing a wealth of information.

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.003
It's an incredible resource,

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:07.008
but it's also crucial to keep in mind

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.009
that anyone can create content and place it on the web.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.008
And that's one of the web's greatest benefits

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.005
as well as one of its potential detriments.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:16.007
It's important to be critical

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.009
when evaluating the accuracy and credibility

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.006
of the content you come across online.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.005
Here are a few strategies you can use

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.007
to judge whether a webpage is reliable

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:29.005
and if the information you find is factual or false.

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.003
You could start with something

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.006
as simple as checking the date

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.000
the article you're reading was published.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.009
Some information on the web is incredibly outdated

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.005
and may not have been updated in years.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.000
Even if the information was accurate at the time,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.005
it may no longer be reliable

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.006
as new data and studies may have emerged since then.

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:47.009
If you determine that the information

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:49.008
is recent and up-to-date,

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.002
next think about who published the information

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:55.003
and what motivation they might have for doing so.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:56.002
While some publishers

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:58.004
want to share factual information online,

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.006
others may be motivated by making money

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.004
or gaining followers online,

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.001
or just spreading their personal beliefs,

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.005
regardless of actual facts.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.001
For example, you may come across an article

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.005
that says everyone should wear hats when outdoors

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:13.000
because sunlight is getting more and more dangerous.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.006
But then you notice that the article is posted

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.000
on a website that sells hats.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.002
Now it may, in fact, be true

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.008
that exposure to sunlight is becoming more dangerous,

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.009
which is why it's important to check multiple sources

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.002
to confirm information you find.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.006
But it's also possible that the author of this article

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.001
is sharing biased information

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.004
in order to sell more of their hats.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.004
Bias isn't always bad, though.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.000
Personal bloggers who publish articles on their own sites

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.009
to share their thoughts and ideas

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.003
may present valuable information or unique perspectives,

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.005
but it's still important to consider

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:44.003
what biases the author may have

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.008
and be able to distinguish between opinion and fact.

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.004
Similarly, it's also important

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.001
to be aware of your own biases

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.009
and to make sure you don't just look for information

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.004
that backs up your current opinions

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:56.003
or perception of the facts.

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.001
Be open to checking multiple resources

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.002
and changing your mind when presented with evidence

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.002
that contradicts your positions.

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:04.005
So those are just a few strategies to keep in mind

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:06.000
as you navigate the web

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.002
to help make sure the information you find and use

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.006
is as reliable and accurate as possible.
