00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] When you upload files to OneDrive,

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.009
you can securely access, update and share them

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.003
from anywhere you have an internet connection.

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.003
There's several ways to upload files to OneDrive.

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:11.008
Let's take a look at a few of the methods here.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.002
After signing in to your account,

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.007
just click the Upload button in the toolbar,

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.001
choose to upload files,

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.008
and then browse for and select the files you want

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.003
to copy to OneDrive.

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:22.008
In this case, I want to upload all three of these,

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:27.000
so I'll just select all three and click Open,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.005
and there are the files.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.006
You can also drag files from your computer directly

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.006
into the OneDrive browser window.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.001
I'll make the browser window a little bit smaller

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:40.000
so I can see my desktop where I have some folders of files.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.009
And again, I can just select the files I want to upload.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:47.009
And in this case, I will drag them into the browser window.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:52.001
You can see they're uploading and there they are.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.000
If you're using the Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.002
you can upload folders of files instead of individual files.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.007
This can make it easier to keep your files organized.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.005
Just click the Upload button again,

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.005
and this time choose a Folder

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:09.009
and then select the folder you want to upload.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.009
I'll confirm that I want to upload the entire folder

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.009
and here's that folder.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.003
Now, if you're using a browser other than Chrome or Edge,

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:19.003
you can create a new folder first

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:22.003
by clicking the New menu and choosing Folder,

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:25.005
giving it a name, and then you can upload

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.000
or drag files into that folder you just created.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.009
I'll click the folder to go into it

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.005
and then I move my window out of the way.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:37.001
I'll select my files and I'll drag them

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:40.000
into the OneDrive window,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.008
and there they are.

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:43.009
And once you've uploaded your files to OneDrive,

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.003
you can get to them from any computer, tablet

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:48.005
or mobile phone with an internet connection.
