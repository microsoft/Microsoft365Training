00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Presenter] The internet and the web make it possible

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:03.009
for us to stay connected with friends

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.000
and family across the world.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.003
We can use social media and other platforms

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.004
to see what's happening in our friends' lives,

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.009
share personal news and stay in touch with others.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.005
But sharing things online isn't always safe.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.006
Things you intend to only be shared with friends

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.003
could be found and viewed by strangers

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.002
in any number of ways.

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.001
For example, imagine you've bought a new car,

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.004
and you want your friends to see it,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.009
so you post a picture on social media.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.005
That might seem fine, but that picture

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.002
includes a lot of personal information about you.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.009
It tells anyone who sees it what make

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:35.004
and model of car you have.

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.004
Some people use their car's make and model as passwords.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.007
If you're one of those people,

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.006
you've just potentially shared your password,

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.009
or maybe part of your password.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:45.009
If the photo includes your license plate,

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:47.007
anyone can see the license plate number

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:50.001
and learn what state you live in.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.007
These might seem like minor things,

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.004
but the more you share, or inadvertently share,

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:56.009
the easier it is for someone to learn information about you

00:00:56.009 --> 00:01:00.001
and build a profile about you, your likes and dislikes,

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.003
where you work, how much you earn and so on.

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:04.007
Now, this doesn't mean you should never post

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.005
or share anything to social media,

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.003
but it's important to keep safety and privacy

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:11.009
as a top concern when you share things online.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.004
Be sure to review the privacy settings

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.001
of your social media accounts.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:16.008
If your account is set to public,

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.006
anyone can see your information and what your share.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.001
Instead, you should use the private settings on accounts,

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.007
so that only your personal connections

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.004
can see what you share.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.008
You should also be selective about accepting invitations

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.002
to connect with people on social media.

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.001
Most social media platforms have a way for you to accept

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.002
and deny requests to have someone be your friend

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.001
or a follower on the site.

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.004
Think about whether you know the person in real life

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:40.003
and if you're comfortable

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:42.009
with them seeing everything you post on that site.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.007
Usually once you accept someone,

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.005
they have direct access to your profile

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.008
and the things you share.

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.001
So make sure you only interact

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.002
with people you know and trust.

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:52.009
Bear in mind that even when you can control

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.009
who has access to your profiles and accounts,

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.004
you can't control what other people do

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.000
with your information.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.008
Even your friends could download your photos

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.006
or copy what you've written to share with others.

00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:04.008
As a general rule, never share something online

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:07.008
that you wouldn't want strangers and the public to see.

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.008
And always remember to think before you share.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:13.004
Do you really need to post what you're thinking of posting?

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:14.007
Are you posting emotionally,

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.000
and will you regret posting it later?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.002
Keep your safety in mind and make smart choices

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:20.007
when sharing things online.
