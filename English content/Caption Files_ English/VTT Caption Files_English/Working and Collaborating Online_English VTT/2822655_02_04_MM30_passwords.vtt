00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] A big part of staying safe

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.002
and keeping your information private online

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.009
is protecting your information,

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.001
your accounts, and your computer, by using strong passwords.

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.002
A strong password is like a strong lock for your home.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.000
You want a lock that is hard to break,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.002
and you don't want anyone else finding the key to your lock.

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.004
Here's some tips for creating a strong password.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.003
Use a combination of letters, numbers,

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.003
and symbols in your password.

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.009
Using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.008
and characters and adding numbers can improve the strength

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.005
of your password.

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.009
Avoid using common words in your password.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.000
This includes common words

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and phrases like password or website,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.006
as well as personal keywords

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.008
that might be easily guessed like your birthday,

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.001
your name, or your hometown.

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.002
Hackers can easily guess

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.001
or research these phrases in your password.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.008
So a unique combination of characters

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.007
and numbers creates a stronger password.

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:54.008
For example, let's say I wanted

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:57.002
to use the word penguin as my password.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.002
That's way too common a word.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:00.006
So one trick is to think of ways

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:02.004
to obscure the word you want to use,

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.001
but still make sure you can remember it

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.005
when it's time to enter your password.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:10.001
Let's say that the year 1972 is personally important to me,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.001
but it's not an obvious year like my birth year

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.000
that could be easily guessed by others.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.002
So I might come up with a password like this,

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.008
where I placed penguin between the digits of the year

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.008
and capitalize two of its letters.

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.001
And then I add a symbol at the end

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:24.006
to make it that much more difficult to guess.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.005
This is much safer

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.008
than just using the word penguin by itself,

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:31.001
and it's a password I can remember without writing down.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:32.005
You can come up with your own strategy

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.007
for creating passwords with the methods similar to this.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.004
Now, with that said,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.003
don't use the same password for multiple sites.

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:43.003
Instead use different passwords for different accounts,

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.005
because if someone guesses your email password,

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:47.003
your safety and privacy may be in trouble

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:50.004
if you use the same password for your bank account.

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:51.007
Be sure to use different passwords

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.003
for each online account you have.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.007
And your password is only for you.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.003
When you share it with others, even friends and family,

00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.003
it's more likely that someone else will use it

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:03.000
or won't keep it safe.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.001
Keep your passwords to yourself.

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.003
When you log in to accounts, make sure you log out

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.006
when you're done and don't save your login information

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.005
on a public computer.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:12.009
And as a general rule,

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.004
you should avoid doing personal business

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.007
on public computers and public networks

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:18.002
as this makes it easier for hackers

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.005
to access your information.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.001
Remember, using strong passwords

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:23.009
and keeping them secure is important

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.002
for your online safety and privacy.

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.000
Keep these tips in mind when you create a new password.
