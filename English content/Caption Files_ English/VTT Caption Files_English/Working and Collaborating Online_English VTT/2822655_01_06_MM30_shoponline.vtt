00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] These days, buying products

00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.008
and services online is pretty easy in most cases

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:06.009
but it can be a little tricky or even scary

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.007
if you haven't done it before or very often.

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.000
There are lots of reasons to make online purchases.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.004
You might be physically far away from a credible seller

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.006
of something you want or maybe you just want to be able

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.008
to browse a variety of stores at the same time

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.001
to find the best options or prices.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.003
Whatever the reason, online shopping allows you to make

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.005
your decisions and purchases quickly and easily

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.000
from your computer.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.009
Before going on a website to make a purchase,

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.008
it's generally a good idea to know what product

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.001
you're looking for and where you might purchase it

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.009
because there are many platforms and sellers

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.007
to purchase from online.

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.009
It can help to do some online research to find content

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:40.009
that can help you decide where to purchase the product

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.003
you're looking for.

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:43.008
You can do this by typing the product's name

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.000
into the browser search bar, followed by the word review.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.009
So for example, maybe I'm interested in finding out

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.009
about the Microsoft Surface tablet.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:56.004
So I could type Surface tablet review.

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.002
This can lead you to reviews that are written by others

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.005
who have purchased the product or service you're looking for

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.004
as well as reviews written by professional

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.002
and trusted sources.

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.004
Combined, these reviews can help you decide if a product

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:10.003
or service is reliable and a good fit for your needs.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.001
Once you've determined the product you want to buy

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.000
and identified a reliable seller,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.007
it's time to make the purchase.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:18.002
Many e-commerce websites make it easy to browse products

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.008
using categories or to search for specific products

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:24.001
using a search bar or to compare similar items.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:26.002
If the product you're looking for has available options

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.001
like different configurations, colors, or features,

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.008
you'll find links to manage your preferences.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.000
When you're ready to purchase a product,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.001
look for a button that's usually labeled buy now

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.001
or add to cart or something similar.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.004
Just like a physical cart at a physical store,

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.005
an online shopping cart keeps tracks of products

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.000
you intend to buy from that site.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.006
So for example, maybe I decided I also

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.003
want to purchase this mouse.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:50.004
I'll click add to cart.

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:52.004
And if I scroll back up, you can see I now have two items

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:53.004
in my cart.

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:55.004
You'll always have the chance to add or remove items

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:57.006
from your cart before you make your purchase.

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.001
So if I change my mind, I can just click remove.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.001
And that takes it out of the cart.

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.003
Once you've added the products you want,

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:05.009
you're ready to check out.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.007
Depending on the shopping website you're using,

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:09.006
you may be required to create an account

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.006
before completing your purchase.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.000
As always, be cautious when sharing your information

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.003
to create an account.

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:17.007
Never share personal information other than the shipping

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.004
and billing information required to make your purchase.

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:22.000
And look in the address bar of the website

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.007
for this lock icon.

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.004
That indicates that the site is encrypted and secure.

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.004
This means that only the company will be able to view

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.003
the information you're sending.

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.007
If you don't see any indication of site security,

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:34.009
don't enter any information and consider making

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.004
your purchase on a different website

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.006
that carries the same products.

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.008
Additionally, it's not a good idea to make purchases

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:42.009
while using a public Wi-Fi network.

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.000
If possible, wait until you're on your home network

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.005
to make your purchases.

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.003
If you have an account with the website you're using,

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.007
you can still browse the site while on a public network.

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:53.005
And the items you add to your cart will often remain there

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.001
when you log into your site again from home

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:57.000
to complete your purchase.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.003
And after completing your purchase, which involves

00:02:59.003 --> 00:03:02.005
entering your name, email address, shipping information,

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:04.009
and payment info like your credit card number,

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.009
you should receive an email confirming your purchase.

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:10.003
Many sites let you then track your order so you can monitor

00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.004
its progress to your location.

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:15.002
So that's the basic rundown of making online purchases.

00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:18.001
When done properly, it can be a convenient way to research

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.009
and buy products from your computer.
