00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] You can use Outlook to keep track

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.000
of your personal appointments

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.009
as well as schedule meetings with other people.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.009
In Outlook, switch to the calendar view

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.009
by clicking this icon in the navigation area

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.008
at the bottom of the window.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.009
I'm currently viewing my calendar by the month,

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.004
but you can click the options in the ribbon

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.009
under the Home tab to also be your calendar by day,

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.000
the workweek, or the entire week as well.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll switch back to the month view for now.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.008
Start by selecting the date of the appointment

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.001
or meeting you want to add to your calendar.

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.000
Then, you can click New Appointment or New Meeting.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.004
The difference between an appointment

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:35.000
and a meeting is that you can invite others to meetings

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.007
and appointments are generally events

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.008
you'll attend on your own or without inviting others.

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.000
I'll choose New Appointment.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.007
Here, enter the title of your appointment,

00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:46.004
and because we selected the date first,

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.001
it should already be filled out correctly

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:49.005
in the start time area,

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.007
but you can change it here if necessary.

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:54.003
Then, select the time of the appointment

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:55.004
and then, enter the end time

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:58.006
to block off that time on your calendar.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.000
You can also select All day to designate

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.006
the appointment as an all day event,

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.005
rather than taking place at a specific time.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:09.003
I'll uncheck that for now, and then, click Save &amp; Close.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.005
And now, that appointment is on my calendar.

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.003
Adding a meeting is very similar.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.003
Just click the date of the meeting

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.005
and then, click New Meeting.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.004
Again, enter a title.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.007
In the Required area, you'll add the names of people

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:24.008
who are required to attend this meeting.

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.000
If you've previously created a contact group,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.002
you can type the group's name here.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:31.002
You can also enter the contact info for people

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:33.008
for whom the meeting is optional.

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:37.006
If necessary, you can add other details like the location.

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.005
Then, click Send.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.003
That adds the appointment to your calendar

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.009
and also emails the meeting invite

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.001
and details to the contacts you added.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.005
So that's how to set up appointments

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.000
and meetings in Outlook.
