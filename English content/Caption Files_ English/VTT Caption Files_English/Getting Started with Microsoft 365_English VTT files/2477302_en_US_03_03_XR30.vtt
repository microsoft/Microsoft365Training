00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Upload, download, rename, delete,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:06.000
all this file management is key to your workflow,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.005
but what's the best way to keep your shared files

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.003
inside Microsoft Teams organized?

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:12.007
Folders.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:13.007
In this lesson,

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.002
I'll show you how to enhance

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.004
your team's organization and workflow

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:21.002
by creating new files and folders in Teams.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.009
For this example, I've already opened Teams,

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.001
and created a team to collaborate on

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:27.006
in an upcoming conference.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.001
I'm working on a skills conference with my team.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.008
I've created a draft flyer

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:33.008
for the presenters of the conference,

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:37.002
but I don't yet have a draft flyer for attendees.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.007
So I first want to set up folders

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.001
to keep my flyers organized.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.001
A flyer is a marketing tool.

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:48.006
So I'll first go to the marketing and PR channel.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.005
Next, I'll select the files tab.

00:00:51.005 --> 00:00:54.001
Now I can set up the folders for the files

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:55.004
to go into.

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.007
I need folders to separate the marketing

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.001
for attendees and presenters.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.005
So I will create those new folders

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.006
by selecting ad new and choosing folder.

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.009
I'll name my folder, attendee marketing,

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.001
and select create.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.008
I've now created a folder

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:15.001
in the marketing channel

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.008
for attendee marketing files.

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.000
I'll do the same for presenter marketing

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
by once again selecting ad new,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.006
choosing folder,

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:29.001
and I'll name this folder presenter marketing,

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.001
and select create.

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:33.005
While in the files tab,

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.002
I want to go into the attendees marketing folder,

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.004
and click the folder.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:41.003
This takes me to the content of this folder.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.004
It's empty right now

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.009
since I just created the folder.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.001
Now, from inside this folder,

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.005
I can create the new file.

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.006
I'll select new,

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.005
and then select PowerPoint presentation.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll name this presentation

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.005
draft attendee flyer.

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:02.001
Once I select create,

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.002
it takes me to my new PowerPoint presentation.

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.005
I use PowerPoint for flyers

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.000
just to use the designer features.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.003
I can use the navigation pane on the left side

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:14.008
to get back to the files tab

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:16.005
for my marketing channel.

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.000
And if I go to the attending marketing folder,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I can see my presentation.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.001
Now you can create and organized files in Teams.
