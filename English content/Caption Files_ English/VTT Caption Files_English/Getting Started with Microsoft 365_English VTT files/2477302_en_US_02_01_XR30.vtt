00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.003
- [Instructor] Like on a television,

00:00:01.003 --> 00:00:03.004
radio, or even walkie-talkie,

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.005
different channels have their own unique purpose

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.006
and their own unique conversations.

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:13.000
In Teams, channels are used to help organize files,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.007
communications, and people around different topics

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.006
to keep team members connected

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:21.008
to what they need to maximize their workflow.

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:23.009
In this lesson, I'll show you how to add

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.001
and remove channels for your team

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.001
so that you can make sure the right people are connecting

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.001
and collaborating in the right places.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.008
I'll start in the team I've created

00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:36.001
for an upcoming skills conference.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.002
I've already created a team, added members,

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.008
and given members appropriate access.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.008
Now want to begin organizing the places

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.002
where we will collaborate and communicate.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.006
Currently, the logistics channel is open

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:51.001
to everyone on the team and anyone that is a part

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.002
of the skills conference team will have access

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.003
to all files and chats.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.000
I would prefer to make logistics private for only

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.009
the team members that are working on logistics directly.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:04.008
But after a channel is created, you can't make it private.

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:06.005
Now I need to delete this channel

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:08.005
to recreate it as a private channel.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:09.007
I'll delete it

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:12.006
by selecting the More Options button beside the name

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:17.007
of the channel, and selecting Delete This Channel.

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.009
It's important to remember that when you delete a channel,

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.004
you delete everything in the channel.

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.003
So make sure when you're ready to delete,

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.004
you're ready to delete everything.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.004
To recreate this same channel

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:31.008
as a private channel,

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:36.003
I'll go back to the team's name and select More Options.

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:38.009
Then select Add Channel.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.004
It prompts me to enter a name.

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:45.001
I will name this channel Logistics Internal.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.002
Now I can adjust this channel's privacy.

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.003
I only want to share this with selected team members,

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:56.007
so I'll choose Private, and then select Create.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.001
Now that I've created a private channel,

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.007
I'm able to add only those select members that need access.

00:02:03.007 --> 00:02:05.002
I'll add one of my teammates

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.005
to this channel by typing in their name,

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.009
selecting Add, and making sure

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.008
the team member has the appropriate access.

00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:17.004
I click Done,

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:21.000
and my team member has been added to my channel.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.004
Now, when there's new activity happening,

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.002
like a new message,

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:29.002
only myself and other invited teammates will see it.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:30.005
So, that's it.

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.000
You're now in control of access

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.003
to information in your teams.

00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:36.009
Try adding channels to your team and test out

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:38.008
which end up getting used a lot

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:40.005
and which channels end up silent.
