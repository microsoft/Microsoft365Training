00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] SharePoint can do many things:

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:06.003
run websites, store files, host resources,

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.000
all from your browser.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.005
In this lesson, I'll show you SharePoint's key features

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.008
so that you can use it with confidence.

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.006
To get started, I'll open SharePoint using a web browser.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.000
Organizations use Microsoft SharePoint

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.008
for a number of reasons.

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:24.006
SharePoint is an app that you connect to through

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.006
your web browser for a variety of purposes.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.001
Not only can you use it to create websites,

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.007
you can also use it as a secure place to store, organize,

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.007
share, and access information from any device.

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.003
I want to use SharePoint to share presenter files

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.004
and resources for a skills conference

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm planning with my team.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
To get started, in the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.002
select the app launcher and open SharePoint.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.007
I am now at my SharePoint start page.

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:58.003
In the top left corner of the SharePoint start page,

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.005
you'll see options to create sites or create a news post

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.005
if you want to make an announcement.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.003
On the navigation bar on the left,

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:11.004
you can easily access your SharePoint start page,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:15.001
the sites you're a member of, new news posts

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.001
from your sites, and your SharePoint files.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:23.001
In the middle of the page is the News from sites section.

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.001
This is where you'll find news from the sites

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.006
that you're a member of.

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:29.004
If you see an article you'd like to view later,

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.002
simply add it to your reading list

00:01:31.002 --> 00:01:34.006
by selecting the bookmark icon on the article.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.002
Once bookmarked, the article is added

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.002
to your Saved for later section

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.003
found in the pane on the left.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.008
Directly under News sites is a section

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:47.005
that displays your most frequently used SharePoint sites

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.001
and the recent activity on each of those sites.

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.006
You can favor a site here by selecting the star

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:56.003
in the upper right corner.

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:59.007
This will add the site to your Following list.

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:01.009
Now that you know your way around SharePoint,

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.009
you're ready to use your SharePoint start page today.
