00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] There will be times

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.005
when you'll want to share news,

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:05.003
a status update on a project

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:06.007
or maybe you want a page

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.007
where people can learn more about an event

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.009
or program.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.001
a SharePoint communication site,

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.000
and show you how to use these sites

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.003
with your team.

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.004
From my SharePoint start page,

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.006
I'll select create site.

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.002
I want to share information,

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.006
and engage other viewers.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:27.009
So I'm going to choose to make this

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.004
a communication site.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:37.004
I'll name the site skills conference page.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.007
For right now, I'll leave the description blank

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.001
because I'll come back later,

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.001
and describe the site's purpose.

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.003
After I've named my site, I'll select finish.

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.000
After I select finish,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.004
I land on my new communication site,

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:57.007
and from here I can edit content.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:59.005
I want to get everyone excited

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:01.004
about the upcoming skills conference.

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.002
So I'm going to use this site

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:04.002
to share information

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.005
to build anticipation for the event.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.007
The site has one page so far, the homepage.

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.005
I like the look of this homepage,

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:15.003
but I want to see if templates

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.005
will offer me other options.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:20.000
So I'll go to the upper right-corner,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.005
and select settings.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.008
I have several options to choose from here.

00:01:26.008 --> 00:01:30.002
The first thing I want to do is apply a site template

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:33.003
to help change the overall layout of my site.

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:35.002
So I'll select that.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.004
Once the select a template window opens,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:41.003
you have several templates to choose from.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:45.000
If you hover over a template and select details,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
you'll get a clearer picture of the site layout,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.009
and what the site is used for.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.004
I want to see more details

00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:54.003
on the showcase template,

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:58.004
so I'll select details.

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:01.001
I like the look of the showcase layout.

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:08.007
So I'll select use template.

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.008
I've created a communication site

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.003
using a template.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.001
I'll need to add content to this site

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.002
before I'm ready to share it with others,

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.005
but I'm off to a super start.

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:20.008
Now you know how to add a communication site

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:21.008
in SharePoint.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:23.008
Soon you'll be ready to add content,

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:25.006
and share your site with others.
