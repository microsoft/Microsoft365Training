00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Sharing information

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.006
is key to business success.

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.007
Your team members may come to your site

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:09.000
to learn or to help build the next idea.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.009
how to share your SharePoint site

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.005
with stakeholders.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:17.003
In this example, I'm responsible for organizing

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.004
a skills conference for my team.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.006
I have a team site for presenters

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.000
working on the conference to collaborate.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.009
I also have a communication site

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.002
to share information about the skills conference

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:30.002
with everyone at my company.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:32.001
I want to share the team site,

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.007
and communication site with the right people.

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:36.009
From the start page,

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.005
I want to go to my skills conference presenters

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.008
team site.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.002
I'll select members,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.004
and the details of my group membership

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.000
appear in a window.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.003
From here I can change permissions,

00:00:50.003 --> 00:00:52.007
and add new members to this site.

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.008
I can also remove members,

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.008
and owners from this group.

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:59.004
Now I'll show you how to change permissions

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.003
on a communication site.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:05.004
I'll navigate to the skills conference page.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:06.006
To manage permissions,

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.001
I'll select share from the upper-right corner.

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.000
I'm the only owner,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.009
and there are no members and no visitors

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.001
on this site.

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.003
Owners have full control of the site.

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.009
Members can view and edit,

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.006
and visitors can only view the site.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.004
From this window,

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.009
I can also add users or groups

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.005
to share this site.

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.001
I want to share the site

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.000
with everyone except external users.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.002
So I'll type in everyone,

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.008
and select everyone except external users.

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.005
Now I'll select share,

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.009
and I'll check the permissions again.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.004
When sharing with everyone except external users,

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:53.001
by default, SharePoint only gives view access

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:54.006
or read permissions.

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:55.005
If needed,

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.001
I could change those permissions

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.002
by selecting the dropdown button under name.

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.005
I'll close share site now.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.003
I have successfully shared my communication site,

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.006
and made sure people had the appropriate access.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.001
Now you can share any site you create

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:13.009
with the appropriate people.

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.000
You can collaborate with a team

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.007
or create an engaging site

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.004
to get people excited about an upcoming event.
