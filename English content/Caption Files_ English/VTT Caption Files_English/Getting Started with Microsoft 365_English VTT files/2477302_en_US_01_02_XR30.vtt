00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Building a team takes time.

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.007
You need to transfer or recruit the right members,

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.004
build relationships and trust each other.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.006
On the other hand,

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.007
creating a team in Microsoft Teams

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.008
takes hardly any time at all.

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:14.006
In this lesson,

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:17.001
I'll use an upcoming event I'm working on,

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.006
the skills conference,

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.009
to show you how to set up a team,

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.001
using templates to save even more time.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:25.005
Let's jump in.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.002
Once I'm in Teams,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.008
I'll select teams from the left menu.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:36.004
Then select join or create a team from the bottom.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.002
If you were joining a team

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.002
that someone else had created,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.009
you might be given a code to join a specific team

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.007
and you'd select join a team.

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.001
Since this conference

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:50.007
doesn't have a team set up already,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:53.008
as the manager, I'll need to create one.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:57.007
So I'll select create team.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.002
I can either create a team from scratch

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:01.009
or from a template.

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.006
I see a manage an event template

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.006
which will work great for this.

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.002
I'll select that option to get started.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.005
Here, Teams will display an overview

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.008
of the channels and apps associated with that template.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:18.006
Just select next to continue.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.007
Next up is the privacy level.

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:23.002
Because I don't want anyone to access my team

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.009
without me inviting them,

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.006
I'll make it private.

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:27.007
For naming the team,

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.005
I want to be brief, but descriptive.

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.005
Since I'm planning a conference,

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:35.004
I'll name it skills conference.

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:36.009
I'll also include a description

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.007
to give the members a way to know

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:40.008
what the team is about.

00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:42.003
Like all templates,

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:44.008
this one comes with pre-made channels.

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:45.009
Think of a channel

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.008
as a place to talk about a specific topic.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:49.009
When I manage events,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.003
I need to create channels

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.003
where the whole team can discuss broad topics

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.005
and other channels where smaller groups

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:59.001
can talk about specific subjects.

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.003
If I expand customize channels,

00:02:02.003 --> 00:02:05.000
I can see all the channels for this team.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.003
The general channel is automatically created

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.004
with every team and cannot be deleted.

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.007
Most of these other channels are useful here,

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.004
but my team won't be a part of

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:19.002
any budget related conversations,

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.005
so I'll rename that one technology

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:24.003
since our conference will be hybrid this year.

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:28.005
I can rename the channel by selecting budget,

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.008
and replacing the channel name.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:33.005
I can save my change

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:37.004
by clicking on customize channels.

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.006
At this point, everything is set up

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:42.000
and I'll select create team.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.004
Now, it does take a little while

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.005
for a team to get set up

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.003
so just be patient

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.008
and come back a little bit later.

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:52.000
As you can see,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.005
it doesn't take much effort

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.002
to create a team.

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.009
When you're able to create a team,

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.000
you're in a position to start streamlining communication

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.008
and collaboration for your next event or project.
