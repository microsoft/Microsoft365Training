00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] When your whole team is using SharePoint

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.000
the level of engagement is incredible,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.008
to further increase your team's engagement

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.008
it's important that you know how to use some

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.003
of the more advanced features of SharePoint.

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:16.004
And this listen, I'm going to show you how to use sections

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.003
and web parts to add more features

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.001
within your SharePoint site.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.004
To get started, I'll open SharePoint.

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:27.007
I've already created a communication site

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:29.008
and named it skills conference page

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.001
for an upcoming conference.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.003
Now I want to change the layout

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.004
and look of the site and add some content.

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:41.002
I want to start by changing the layout on this page.

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:44.001
The layout of a SharePoint page is made up

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.002
of different sections.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:50.000
Sections are distinct areas on the page

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.008
and each component in a section is called a web part.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.006
Before I can make any changes, I need to go

00:00:56.006 --> 00:01:00.006
to the top right corner and select edit,

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:04.006
on the left bar I can edit my sections.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:09.006
I simply click the plus and options open up,

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:15.000
I can add, edit, move, duplicate,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.001
or delete a section from here.

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.003
I want to remove one of my sections,

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:22.009
so I'll scroll down to the section

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.005
I'd like to remove, select it,

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:30.006
and in the options on the far left, select delete.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.004
I can see the section has been deleted.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.000
Now I want to edit the web part

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.006
in the section at the top of this page,

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:43.005
this web part is a hero which allows you to display

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.007
up to five items using text, images, and links.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.008
To edit this web part

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.008
I'll select it and select edit web part,

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:58.008
I can display my hero web part as tiles or layers.

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.008
Selecting tiles displays my hero with images and links,

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:05.009
selecting layers displays my hero with images,

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.005
text, and links.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:10.002
I want to display text and images,

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:14.004
so I'll keep layers selected from my layout options.

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.003
One of the features that makes SharePoint so useful

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:21.003
is you can easily edit when you need to add more content.

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.009
Currently, my site has three layers.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.009
A layer contains an image, text, and a link.

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.004
I only have a small amount of content that I want to share,

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.006
so I only need one layer.

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:37.007
So under layout, I will choose the one layer layout.

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.009
Now that I've got the right layout,

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.003
I can start to edit the image,

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:45.000
text, and link for my web part.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.004
To edit the individual components of a web part,

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:52.002
I need to go to edit web part details.

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:54.002
I need to select the web part

00:02:54.002 --> 00:02:57.002
and find the edit details button,

00:02:57.002 --> 00:03:01.008
once selected an edit menu pops up with the edit options,

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.000
right now I don't need to link anything,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so I want to remove the link.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.001
I just need to go down to the options menu and expand it,

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.004
for this web part the link is actually

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:14.005
a part of a call to action,

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:16.000
so to remove the link

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.005
I'll just select no for show call to action link.

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:24.004
When I'm ready to add a link I can move show call to action

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:27.008
to yes, and add my link and call to action

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:29.006
text when I'm ready.

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:32.004
I want to change the text for this web part,

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:35.003
so I'll edit the title and description

00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:38.005
to be specific to the skills conference.

00:03:38.005 --> 00:03:42.001
I see that my new title and description have been added,

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:44.009
now I want to change the image that's displayed

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:46.005
on this web part.

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:51.003
I'll expand the background image section and select change.

00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:53.002
I don't have images of my own to use,

00:03:53.002 --> 00:03:56.006
so I'll select stock images.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.002
I'll search for conference

00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:03.005
in the search bar and select a photo I like,

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:09.001
once I've selected the image, I'll see the image on my page.

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.007
Under the image in the background section

00:04:11.007 --> 00:04:15.000
I will add alternative texts to make my site accessible

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.005
for those who can't see it,

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:20.001
the changes I've made look great.

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:24.001
I want to add one more thing to my page before I finish,

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.007
a countdown timer to get the team excited

00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:29.003
about the upcoming skills conference.

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:31.008
I'll close this web part for now.

00:04:31.008 --> 00:04:34.000
Before I add the countdown timer,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.005
I want to clean up my page a bit.

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:40.000
I want to select showcase a variety of images

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.007
and remove that web part.

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:45.002
Now I want to add a new web part

00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:48.002
and I'll add a countdown timer.

00:04:48.002 --> 00:04:51.000
You can change the title and description directly

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.002
from this web part by selecting them,

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:57.003
I'll change the title to skills conference

00:04:57.003 --> 00:05:01.003
and change the description to countdown to fun.

00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:04.009
You can also change the date and time for your countdown

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.006
or even add a call to action link or a background image,

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:10.005
lots of options to customize

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:12.007
the look of this countdown timer.

00:05:12.007 --> 00:05:17.005
Looks great to me, so I'll close my editing window.

00:05:17.005 --> 00:05:20.006
I like this look, it's a great landing page

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:21.008
and I know I can come back

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:25.000
and easily add or edit more content.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.001
I'll select republish to make sure that

00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.005
when I share my site,

00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:31.004
everyone else can see the updated version.

00:05:31.004 --> 00:05:33.007
Now you can make engaging sites

00:05:33.007 --> 00:05:35.007
using sections and web parts.

00:05:35.007 --> 00:05:36.006
Give it a try.
