00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] An important part of collaboration

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.002
is gathering input from team members

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.000
about the work you're creating.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.002
Team's channels make it easy to share your work.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to pass files

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:13.006
back and forth with your teammates

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.002
in your Microsoft Team's channels.

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.000
In this example, I'm working on a skills conference,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.007
and I have a team and channels set up.

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.009
There are two ways to add a file to a team's channel.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.009
You can share a file in the posts

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.004
or you can add a file to the File tab in the channel.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:34.002
Let's dive in to see this in action.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.009
For this example, I've already opened Teams

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.006
and created a team to collaborate on an upcoming conference.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.009
I'll first show you how to share a file

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.000
in a post in a channel.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.004
I want to share a list of the rooms we have for the conference

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.003
and the number of people that can fit in each room.

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:54.003
In the Logistics channel, I will create a post

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.009
and then select attach to attach my file to the post.

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:03.001
I will select attach from the menu in the conversation

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.003
and navigate to the file I want to attach.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:11.003
Once I select the file, I'll choose Upload a copy.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.002
The file is now attached to my message.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:16.003
I can now select send

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.007
and post the file to the Logistics channel.

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:22.005
Once the file is posted, I can find the file

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:26.002
in the Files tab in the Logistics channel.

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.006
In addition to sharing files in a post in a channel,

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.006
I can also upload files directly to the Files tab.

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.008
Adding files directly to the Files tab

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:38.000
allows you to manage the files' structure

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.002
or where the files are placed.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:43.004
I want to share a flyer in the Marketing channel,

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:48.005
so I'll start there and select the Files tab.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.001
The flyer I'm uploading is a draft flyer

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.005
for presenters at the conference.

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:56.000
So I want to select the Presenter marketing folder to open it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.008
I already have this document,

00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.008
so I'll choose Upload from the menu.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:07.005
I'll select Files, and I'll select my DRAFT Speaker Flyer.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.009
Open it.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.009
My document is now in this folder.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.002
Now that you can share files with your team

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:18.005
through posts and in the Files tab,

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.003
you'll be collaborating with your team in no time.
