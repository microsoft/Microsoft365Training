00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Keeping everyone on the same page

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.002
makes any team more efficient.

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.001
But when new members join,

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.000
valuable time can be wasted in bringing them up to speed.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.002
With Microsoft Teams,

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:15.002
modifying who's part of your team is simple and easy.

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.003
In this lesson, I'll show you how to add team members

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.000
and manage their roles in Teams.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.003
To show you how, I've created a team

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.003
for a conference I'm working on.

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:27.004
To bring everyone together to collaborate,

00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.001
I need to make sure they are added to the team.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:33.005
I'll start on the main Teams page.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.000
To find the Skills conference team,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.008
I'll use the menu to select teams from the sidebar.

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.006
Here you can see a list of all my teams.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.000
I'll navigate to the Skills conference team

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.009
and select More options.

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.002
Then select Add member.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.009
Since I'll be adding new members that are already a part

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:56.005
of my organization, I'll be able to add them

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.000
by typing in their name or email address

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.007
and then selecting Add.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.000
To add people outside of your organization

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.009
is a little different.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.009
You still add them using their email address

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.000
but they will be added to the team as a guest.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.006
Guest roles cannot be changed.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:18.008
When someone inside your organization is added to a team,

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.007
their initial role is member.

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.005
But you can change their role to owner, if you want.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.001
Owners have the same permissions as members

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.004
but can also delete your team

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.004
and add or remove team members.

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:34.008
You can change a member's role to owner

00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:39.001
by selecting the dropdown menu next to their assigned role.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.001
In case the team needs editing when I'm away,

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.006
I'll add my colleague, Isaiah, as an owner.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.000
Now that you can add team members to a team

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.005
and assign their roles,

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.001
you can start gathering the right people together

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.005
to collaborate on a project or event.
