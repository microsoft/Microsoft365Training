00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Sometimes you need your message to stand out.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.008
A larger font, different colors, or maybe something more,

00:00:05.008 --> 00:00:08.001
all these make your message clearer.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.009
In this lesson, I'll show you how to edit

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.001
the formatting of your Team's post to highlight your message

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.007
and make key items more apparent.

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.006
Since I am responsible for planning a skills conference

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:20.008
with a team of people,

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.004
it will be a great example to show.

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:24.003
For this example,

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.008
I've already opened Teams and created a team to collaborate

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:29.002
on an upcoming conference

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:31.005
that we're all working on together.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.009
I've created a team

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.001
to streamline our work and communication,

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.009
but I also want to share some upcoming tasks

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.006
that need to be completed.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.000
I want to use some additional formatting features

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.003
to add to my post.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:47.007
So I'll go to Announcements and select new conversation.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.003
Then select format.

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.009
From here, I'll change and edit the announcement

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.003
before I post it.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.001
I'll use a heading in bullets

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.006
to share the action items for the week.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.009
The Mention feature is used to get the attention

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.002
of people or groups for specific action items.

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.002
Since I want the marketing and PR group

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:06.005
to have a draft flyer,

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.009
I'll mention this group in the first item in my list.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.001
I want Joni to set up a call for the team.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.007
I can mention her and ask her to set up a call.

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:19.004
I'll make this the second item on my list.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.009
I need everyone on the team to submit weekly updates,

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.003
so I need to make that task stand out.

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.000
So I'll go to the formatting ribbon,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.004
select bold, then select change font color, and choose blue.

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:39.008
Now, I'll type in a task for everyone.

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.004
Now, my text really stands out.

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.004
My post looks good.

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.006
To send it to the team,

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.001
I'll select Send and off it goes.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.006
Formatting a post is a really simple way

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.000
to make what you have to say really stand out.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.004
Now you can make your messages do more for you.
