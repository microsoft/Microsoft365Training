00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.002
- [Instructor] Isn't it frustrating

00:00:01.002 --> 00:00:02.006
when you can't change a setting

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.005
or access a tool you need to do your job?

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.003
In this lesson,

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.004
I'll show you how to manage the permissions

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.006
of your team members

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.000
so that everyone has the access they need

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to do their jobs effectively.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.004
When managing a team,

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.005
you need to decide what access your team members should have

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.008
and you can make sure your team has the appropriate access

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.001
by using the Manage Team Settings feature.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.002
To manage the settings for my team,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:32.006
I'll select More Options then select Manage Team.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:35.006
I can now access the Settings tab.

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.008
Here, I can manage multiple settings for my team.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.006
For now, I'm just going to focus on Member Permissions.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.001
To control the team's workflow, I only want owners

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.002
to be able to change the channels in our team.

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.007
So in Member Permissions,

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:56.002
I'll deselect Allow Members to Create and Update Channels

00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.006
and also deselect

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:01.004
Allow Members to Delete and Restore Channels.

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:05.001
I'll make sure guests have the same access.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.009
Now you know how to adjust the settings

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.007
to make Teams work in a way that's perfect for your group.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.003
Take your time making sure your team members and guests

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:16.002
have the access they need and you can feel confident

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:18.002
about protecting the teams you own.
