00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.008
- Keeping track of all the communications,

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.000
documents and events for one project can be daunting.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.003
Luckily, creating a SharePoint team site

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:12.002
can help you keep track of all those items in one place.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.001
In this lesson,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.002
I'll show you how to create your own SharePoint team site,

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:19.005
so you can collaborate and keep organized.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.002
I'm working with a team of people

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.002
to organize the Skills conference together.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:25.009
We're going to use SharePoint

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.008
as a place to organize our work,

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:30.007
so I need to create a team site for us.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.001
From my SharePoint start page,

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.003
which is like my own little SharePoint dashboard,

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.002
I'll select Create site.

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:40.004
This opens a window

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:43.008
where I can choose the type of site I'd like to create.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:48.006
I can choose either a Team site or a Communication site.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.003
A Team site can be used to collaborate with a team,

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.006
whereas a Communication site can be used

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.000
to share content that keeps other people informed.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.008
I'll choose the Team site to help me collaborate

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:04.002
with the presenters for the Skills conference.

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:07.008
Creating a team site, connects your teammates in a group

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.007
and provides everyone with a shared notebook,

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:13.001
email address, and team calendar.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:18.001
I'll name my team, "Skills conference presenters."

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.006
When you enter a name for your site,

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:23.007
SharePoint tells you whether the site name is available.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.002
Make sure you choose an available name before you continue.

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.004
I'll add a site description later,

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:33.000
but for now, I want to choose the privacy options.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.001
So I'll select Next.

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.003
When I select Next, it opens the option for me

00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:41.002
to add site owners and members.

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:43.006
I can add members from my organization

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.006
by typing in their names.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.004
I'm only sharing this site with a few people,

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:51.003
so we can work together and add content.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:52.008
Then I'll be ready to share it

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:54.008
with the rest of my colleagues.

00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:58.007
I'll add Joni, Isaiah and Lynne.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:01.005
Initially, everyone is added as a member,

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:04.002
but I can make a member an owner of the team site

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.004
by selecting the dropdown box next to their roles

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:09.002
and selecting Owner.

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:12.003
Site owners have full administrative control

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.004
over the site and its content,

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:16.009
whereas site members can only edit

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.002
and view content within the site.

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:23.000
I'll add Isaiah as an owner to my site,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.002
just in case I'm ill or on vacation.

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:27.009
I want to make sure someone else has full control

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.003
over the site with me.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:31.005
Once I've decided who will be owners,

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:35.004
I'll select Finish to add users and publish the site.

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.009
At this point, I can start designing my site,

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.004
but I'll do that later.

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:43.000
I'm now at the homepage of my newly created team site.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
On our homepage,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.008
we have several options in our navigation pane.

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.008
Since I'm using the site to share files and resources

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.006
for the Skills conference,

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.008
I'm going to focus on the documents

00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:56.005
and pages portion of my site.

00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:57.008
In the Document section,

00:02:57.008 --> 00:03:02.004
I can upload documents and add new folders or new files.

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:07.002
In Pages, I can see all the pages on my SharePoint site.

00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:10.002
Right now, I only have the homepage.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.000
If I want to share a piece of important information

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.002
with my team, I can go to Home, select Add new,

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:20.008
and then select News post.

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:22.005
This takes me to templates,

00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.009
where I'll select the blank template.

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.004
Then I'll select Create post.

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:30.008
I'm going to use this post to count down the weeks

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.002
until the Skills conference.

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:35.007
So I'm going to name the post to reflect that.

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:38.003
I'm going to remind everyone that we have four months

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:40.000
until the Skills conference,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.009
and ask that they submit their proposals

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.008
for conference sessions this week.

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:48.002
Then I'll select Post news.

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:51.007
Now, when I return to the homepage of my SharePoint site,

00:03:51.007 --> 00:03:53.009
I can see my news post.

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.007
Eventually, I'll share the site with my whole team

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:59.002
and the countdown will help everyone get excited

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:01.000
for the upcoming conference.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.003
Now that you know how to create a team site,

00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:06.006
you're one step closer to collaborating in SharePoint.
