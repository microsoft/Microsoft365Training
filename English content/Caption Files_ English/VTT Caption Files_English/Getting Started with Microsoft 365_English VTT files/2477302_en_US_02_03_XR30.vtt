00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Sometimes the best way to communicate

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.007
with your team is by picking up the phone

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.001
and talking to them.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.005
Teams allows you to do just that

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:11.004
using an internet connection without using an actual phone.

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.001
In this lesson, I'll show you the different ways

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.000
to make direct phone calls using Teams.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.008
Once you're in Teams, there are several ways to make calls.

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.000
First I'll show you how to call a contact directly

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.001
from a chat.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.003
To call from a chat, open the chat you want to call from.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.006
Calling from a chat will call everyone in the chat.

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:31.009
In the upper right corner,

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.009
you can see there's a button for a video or audio call.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.008
When you're ready to make your call,

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.006
simply select video call

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.009
or audio call and Teams will connect you.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.004
Next I'll show you how to make calls using calls.

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:51.000
Select calls from the left side of the app.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.006
From the phone tab, you can make a call

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.003
by entering the name of the person you want to join the call

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.008
in the type a name box.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:00.001
You can add multiple people here.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.009
Then select call to make the call.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.006
Another way to make calls is to select someone

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.000
from your call history.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.002
Just hover over a previous call and select the call button

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:14.009
once it appears.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.007
You can also make calls from your contacts tab.

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:20.009
Find the contact you would like to call.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.005
Then select the type of call you want to make.

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.007
Either a video call or an audio call.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.003
Here you can also send a direct message

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.004
or an email to any one of your contacts.

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:33.009
I want to call Isaiah so we can chat

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.002
about a meeting we just had

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:38.002
for an upcoming skills conference that we're planning.

00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:41.003
Before I call, I want to check his presence.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:44.007
Presence shows your availability and status to others

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.003
and as part of your profile in Teams.

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:49.000
To help you better understand presence,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.003
I'll show you the different presence states

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.000
and how to change your status in Teams.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.008
The little dot

00:01:54.008 --> 00:01:58.002
on my profile indicates my availability.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.000
To change your availability, go to your profile

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and select a status from the list.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.001
There are different symbols for each status.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:10.004
So take a moment to familiarize yourself with them.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.003
There are symbols to indicate when you're available,

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:17.001
busy, when you don't want to be disturbed, when you are away,

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.000
and when you are offline.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.009
I want to call Isaiah

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:24.001
but I can see that Isaiah is in do not disturb.

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.000
So I won't call him now.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.007
But I see Lynne is available

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:30.001
and she might have the information I need

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.005
so I'll give her a call.

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:36.004
Now that you know how to make phone calls in Teams,

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.006
find a way to use each of these methods

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.002
to make calls on your Teams.
