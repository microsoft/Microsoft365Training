00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Instructor] The best teams,

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.005
the groups that stand out above the rest,

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:07.006
work incredibly well together.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.001
Each individual team member

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.006
understands the end goal, stays focused

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:17.006
and willingly and enthusiastically collaborates.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:22.008
Microsoft's chat-based workspace Teams is the perfect place

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.008
to make that engagement and collaboration happen

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.002
in your workplace.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:31.004
In this lesson, I'll show you why Teams is such a great tool

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.005
to make the most of your team.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.002
Let's dive in.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:38.001
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:41.006
select the app launcher and open Teams.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.004
Before discussing specific features in Teams,

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:46.005
I want to explain the layout.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.004
The Teams homepage has a menu to the left

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.004
and a search bar at the top.

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:55.002
Select Activity to see your feed.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:58.002
This is where you'll find mentions, replies

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:00.001
and other notifications.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.009
If you select filter and more options

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.005
you can search for a specific type of activity,

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:10.003
like mentions, replies or reactions.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:13.000
Chat is one of the main ways you can quickly communicate

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.008
with people or groups.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:19.004
Select Chat to see the different conversations you're having

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.007
with groups or individuals.

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:26.002
You can filter in Chat to show unread chats,

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:28.006
meetings, or muted chats.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:32.000
Selecting Teams allows you to see all the Teams

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.002
you are a member or owner of.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:39.001
Teams is the ultimate filter when it comes to workflow.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.007
A Team can house your communication and files in one place

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.002
so you can compartmentalize your work

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.001
into specific projects or groups.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.007
You can call an individual or jump on a conference call

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.003
with voice and or video.

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:59.004
If you select Calls, you can see your call history

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.002
and your contacts.

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.007
Select Contacts, and you can see a list

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:06.007
of all your contacts.

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:11.009
You can also add contacts here using the add contact button.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.001
The search bar can save you valuable time

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.000
searching for content in Teams.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.004
You can search for contacts, messages,

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.008
files and more all in one place.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.006
With an integration with Outlook, you have access

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.008
to your calendar in the place you work.

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.002
As you're working and collaborating with teammates

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:29.008
you may want to know when you're free

00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:32.007
for a follow-up chat or to work on a task.

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:36.003
Select Calendar to find your scheduled meetings.

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:40.009
And, finally, you've got access to OneDrive right here.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:44.004
Need to quickly access a file you're collaborating on?

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:48.001
Selecting Files will allow you to access files

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.007
in Teams and OneDrive.

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:54.003
Now that you understand the value and the layout of Teams,

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.001
you're ready to get into action.
