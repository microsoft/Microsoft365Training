00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Narrator] The best workplaces are filled with

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.002
collaboration, teamwork and shared activities.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.002
Positive results come from a team

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.003
where everyone works towards a shared goal.

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:13.005
Each member knows their role and responsibilities,

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:14.007
and clear communication

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.008
makes collaborating something to look forward to.

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.003
But how do you facilitate that with a modern team?

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.001
With Microsoft 365, of course.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.003
I'm Courtney Hodge, a Program Manager at Microsoft,

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.006
and I'm passionate about helping people use technology

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.006
to make their lives easier.

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:34.004
In this course,

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:37.005
I'll give you the tools to maximize Microsoft Teams

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.006
to support your communication and collaboration.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.004
I'll teach you how to use SharePoint

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.002
to work with your team and create engaging sites

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:48.007
to get people excited about events or programs.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.001
I'll show you how to integrate these tools

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:55.004
into your team's workflow and how to gain new efficiency

00:00:55.004 --> 00:00:57.007
in everything you do at work.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.006
I don't know about you,

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:02.005
but group projects were never my favorite in school.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.009
But learning to utilize Microsoft Teams and SharePoint

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.002
makes working with your team easy and efficient.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.003
So if you're ready

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.002
to take your teamwork to the next level,

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.000
let's jump right in.
