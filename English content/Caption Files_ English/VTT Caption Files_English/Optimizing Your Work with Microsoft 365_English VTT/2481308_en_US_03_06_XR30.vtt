00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Delivering a PowerPoint presentation,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.002
is an exciting experience.

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.005
You've put time into creating the presentation,

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.001
and now it's time to share it with others.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.001
With speaker notes and PowerPoint,

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.003
you can have access to key talking points

00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:15.006
and important information you're presenting,

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.006
no memorization needed.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.005
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.003
how to add and use speaker notes

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:24.002
and share your presentation with others.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.008
First, I'm going to open a PowerPoint presentation.

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.002
Follow along by downloading the sample presentation

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.008
in your exercise files,

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:36.002
it's called customer event example A.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.007
To create speaker notes in the presentation,

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:42.004
I'll navigate to the top open and select the view tab.

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:47.001
Next, select the notes under the top ribbon beneath file.

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.005
The notes pane appears across the bottom portion

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.001
of the PowerPoint window.

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:54.001
With the cursor blinking and ready for me to begin typing,

00:00:54.001 --> 00:01:00.008
I'll input my speaker notes.

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:02.009
If I don't need the notes to be visible,

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.006
I can select the notes tab again

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.001
and the notes pane will disappear.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.006
If I'm presenting in PowerPoint online,

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:13.008
I will only be able to see notes from the notes pane.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.008
You can have them visible while editing and when printing

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.006
but not while presenting.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.008
Printed speaker notes are good resource to have for yourself

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:23.003
while presenting or if you need

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.004
to share the presentation with notes.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:27.006
To print your slides with notes,

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.008
navigate to the top ribbon and select file.

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.000
Next select print.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.009
Then print note pages.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.002
When printing your notes, each slide will have its own page

00:01:41.002 --> 00:01:45.002
with the appropriate notes underneath the slide.

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:49.007
You can also print the presentation as handouts.

00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:50.007
To print handouts,

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.007
I'll go to the top ribbon and select file,

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:57.007
then print, then print handouts.

00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:00.008
The printed page will print with three slides per page

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:03.000
and lines for personal note taking

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.001
to the right of each slide.

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.001
To share the presentation virtually,

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:13.002
I'll navigate to the top ribbon and select file, then share.

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:16.008
Next, select share with people.

00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:20.004
From here I can enter the names or email addresses

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:24.008
of the people I want to share with.

00:02:24.008 --> 00:02:26.001
To modify permissions,

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:33.004
select the dropdown menu next to the pencil icon.

00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:43.008
I'll include a message to describe the presentation,

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.009
and select send.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.008
Alternatively, I can select copy link

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:53.006
to create a link that I can copy to an email

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:57.003
to share the presentation.

00:02:57.003 --> 00:03:00.002
Having your notes and knowing how to share your presentation

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:04.001
sets you up for a smooth delivery of your information.

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:06.002
Try sharing your slides and notes

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.001
the next time you have a presentation.
