00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] When you're working on an important document,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.002
receiving constructive feedback

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.008
and suggestions from members of your team, can be helpful.

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.004
Reviewing documents can create

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:11.006
an even better finished product.

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.009
In this lesson, I'll show you how you and your team

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.008
can work on documents together in Microsoft Word,

00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.000
by making the most of the review tab.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
To get started, I'll open Word

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.001
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.003
You can follow along with the sample Word document

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.002
in your exercise files,

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:36.008
it's called document review.

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.000
In this example, I'll be reviewing

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.008
and editing a document drafted for an upcoming event.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.006
With document review open,

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:49.006
I'll navigate to the top ribbon and select review.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.000
This is a document I've shared with my colleagues

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.008
and they've made some edits.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.003
Before I jump into the collaborative tools,

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:59.003
I'll start by taking advantage of the proofreading tools

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.001
on the top left of the ribbon,

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:06.009
editor, word count, check accessibility, and translate.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.000
Word count displays the documents statistics,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.008
how many words, characters and paragraphs there are.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:23.004
When I select editor,

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.004
the document stats is available in the sidebar

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.009
and tells me all I need to know about my document.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.009
This can be helpful when creating documents

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.008
that have specific parameters.

00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:38.009
When I check accessibility,

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.003
the panel opens to the right side of the screen

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.004
with a list of errors and warnings,

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:50.000
as well as a list of tips on how to fix each issue.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.001
To translate my text to over 50 languages,

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:57.000
I can use translate, on either a selection,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.005
or the full document.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:07.004
Next, let's look at the collaborative tools.

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:09.006
When multiple people are working in Word,

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.000
track changes allows you to keep track

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.009
of what's been changed in the document,

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.005
and gives you the opportunity to either accept,

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:19.002
or reject those changes.

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:25.004
I'll select track changes at the top ribbon to enable it.

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:31.002
Then I'll choose either, track for everyone, or just mine.

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:32.009
For everyone means that all those

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.007
with access to the document

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:36.009
will see the suggested edits that are made

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.000
and who made them.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.005
If I only want the suggested edits to appear when

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.006
I make changes, I'll select just mine.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.007
In this case, I want to track everyone's changes,

00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:53.006
so I'll select for everyone.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.009
When final decisions are being made about the document,

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.009
those suggested changes can either be accepted or rejected,

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:07.004
by selecting the underlined text,

00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:15.007
or by selecting accept or reject in the ribbon.

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.003
When I want to stop suggesting

00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:19.005
and start making changes directly,

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:22.008
I'll select track changes,

00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:28.005
and in the dropdown menu, I'll select off.

00:03:28.005 --> 00:03:32.004
Review also allows for easy communication with comments.

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:36.001
To add a comment, I'll select the location in the document,

00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:47.005
right-click, and in the dropdown menu, select new comment.

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.002
A text box appears to the right of the margin

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:58.006
where I'll add my comment,

00:03:58.006 --> 00:04:02.009
and select send when I'm finished.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:08.007
Select show comments,

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:10.004
and the comments panel will appear

00:04:10.004 --> 00:04:12.006
to the right of the document.

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:21.009
I can reply in the box,

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.005
or link to, resolve, or delete comments

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:30.007
by selecting the three dots in the top right corner.

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:33.004
Resolving the comment will gray out the box,

00:04:33.004 --> 00:04:37.006
but the comment will remain as a part of the document.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:40.006
In most cases, once the comment is addressed

00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:42.008
I prefer to delete it.

00:04:42.008 --> 00:04:45.009
Being able to review and track the revisions of documents,

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.008
supports quick edits and collaborations.

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:52.009
Try enabling these editing tools in your next document.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.007
Remember, not everyone gets it right the first time,

00:04:55.007 --> 00:04:58.007
so let Microsoft Word support your revision process.
