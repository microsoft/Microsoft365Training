00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Narrator] Working with outside organizations

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.006
is a part of collaboration

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.007
and it's important to make any partnership experience

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.008
as seamless as possible.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:12.000
In Teams, guests can participate in meetings,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.003
chats, and work on documents.

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:17.007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to invite external guests

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.008
and manage the settings and permissions

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.005
needed to work with them in Teams.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.007
To get started, I'll open Teams

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:30.000
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.001
First, I'll select the team I want to add guests to.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.003
In that team, I'll select more options

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.009
to the right of the name of that team.

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:41.004
And then I'll select Add member.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:48.009
Here, I'll enter my guest email addresses.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:50.009
When I'm done selecting all the guests,

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:57.004
select Add and the guests will be sent an email invitation.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.006
A guest will have the label Guest attached to their name

00:01:00.006 --> 00:01:05.005
wherever it's displayed in Microsoft Teams.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.004
You can also check the top of any channel

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.000
to see how many guests are in it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.004
by selecting the information icon in the top right.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:19.002
To close it, select the information icon again.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.004
To set specific guest access,

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:26.001
select next to the team name for more options.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:30.007
From there, select Manage team.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:37.003
In the Settings tab, select the Guest permissions dropdown

00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.004
to select or clear options or permissions

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.001
that you want to use.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.007
Well done.

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:45.006
Now you're ready to add external guests

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.008
and set specific permissions for them.

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.008
You'll be collaborating in no time.
