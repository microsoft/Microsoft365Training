00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] Have you ever taken detailed notes only

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.004
to have to sift through them later in order

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.008
to find that one thing you jotted down halfway through?

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.002
What a pain.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:10.008
In this lesson, I'm going

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:12.006
to share how you can use OneNote

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.005
to help organize your notes.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:22.001
I'll start on the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.005
Select OneNote on the left side of the menu.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:28.007
In this example, I'll create a notebook for an event

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:34.005
that I'm organizing by selecting New notebook.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.000
Name your notebook.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.005
I'll name mine Customer Event, then select Create.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:48.002
Each OneNote notebook contains sections,

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.006
and each section contains pages,

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.007
as you can see underneath the menu on the left side.

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:58.009
To add content to a notebook, you need to add structure.

00:00:58.009 --> 00:01:02.000
First, with sections and then pages,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and then subpages within those sections.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.008
Since there are a lot of meetings happening for this event,

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:11.001
I'll create a section by pressing Enter

00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:20.000
on this empty notebook page and call the section Agenda.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.005
Inside this new section,

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:24.000
a blank page is automatically created.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.001
To keep each page of notes organized,

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:31.007
I'll title this page Breakout Sessions,

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:34.001
and now the page Breakout Sessions,

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.004
inside the section Agenda, in the notebook Customer Event,

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.001
I can finally start jotting down my thoughts.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.005
To add more pages to each section,

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.004
navigate to the bottom and select Add page

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:51.002
and give it a title.

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:58.008
I'll add two more pages, Group A

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:03.008
and Group B.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.007
To add more sections to the notebook,

00:02:05.007 --> 00:02:13.000
select Add section at the bottom and give it a title.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.006
I'll add one more section and call it Planning.

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:23.002
To rename a page or section, select it,

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:28.004
then right-click it and choose Rename,

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:29.009
then enter the new name.

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:34.001
I'll rename this Logistics.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.004
To add even more structure to your notes,

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.000
you can turn your pages into subpages.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.008
For example, you can make Group A and Group B subpages

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.003
of the whole Breakout Sessions page.

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:50.004
To change a page to a subpage, right-click it

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:54.004
and select Make Subpage.

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:57.007
You'll see the title indent right under your main page,

00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:00.008
showing that it is now a subpage.

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:03.007
To change the subpage back into a regular page,

00:03:03.007 --> 00:03:08.003
right-click on it and select Promote Subpage.

00:03:08.003 --> 00:03:11.005
Outside of the structural hierarchy, OneNote makes it easy

00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:15.000
to find what you're looking for with tags and search.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Tags can be used to categorize

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.004
and prioritize notes in your workbook.

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:23.003
With tags, you can quickly return to notes,

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.005
remind yourself about action items

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.007
or simply mark what's important.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:32.000
To apply a tag, navigate to the page you want to work on,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.004
then place your cursor at the beginning

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:38.004
of the line of text that you want to tag.

00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:42.007
Next, go to Home in the top ribbon and select Tags.

00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:45.003
Choose the tag you want to apply, select it,

00:03:45.003 --> 00:03:48.005
and it appears next to the text.

00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:55.002
To remove a tag, right-click it and select Remove Tag.

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.009
To search your notebook, go to the menu on the left

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.008
and select the magnifying glass icon.

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:04.009
In the search box, enter a keyword or phrase.

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:08.000
As you're typing, OneNote begins returning results

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.002
that match your search.

00:04:10.002 --> 00:04:16.005
Choose a result to retrieve that matching note.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:18.002
When you're done with the search,

00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:22.009
press the Escape key on your keyboard.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.008
Now that you've organized your notes,

00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:27.002
it's important to know where they're saved.

00:04:27.002 --> 00:04:29.008
Notes are automatically and continually saved

00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:32.008
in the cloud, your OneDrive.

00:04:32.008 --> 00:04:34.004
OneNote is a helpful tool

00:04:34.004 --> 00:04:36.009
for capturing and organizing notes.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.003
Try using tags and subpages

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:41.007
in OneNote in your meetings this week

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:44.007
and use the tools to keep your notes organized.
