00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Have you ever needed more than just words

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.003
to capture ideas correctly?

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.004
Having images or videos can be helpful

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.003
to reference along with notes.

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.006
In this lesson,

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.003
I'll show you how to insert media

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.000
and tables into OneNote

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.006
to create an interactive notebook in OneNote.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.003
So first, I'll open OneNote

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:25.002
to an existing notebook of mine, customer event.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:26.007
To add a picture,

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:31.004
place the cursor where you want to add it.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.000
Select Insert from the top ribbon, then Picture,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.005
and select From Online.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.008
In the search bar,

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:42.003
type the name of an image you are looking for

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:48.004
and press Enter.

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.000
Use the scroll bar on the right side of the window

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.002
and select the picture that works best for you.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:01.008
Select Insert when finished.

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:03.009
The picture will add and appear in your notes

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:08.007
where you placed it.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.008
Let's say you want to reference another file

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:12.000
in your notes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.006
To attach a copy of a file to your notebook,

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:21.004
you'll place the cursor where you want to link the file.

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:26.007
Select Insert, then File.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.009
Then Insert File Attachment.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:39.001
Select the file you want, and then select Open.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:41.005
You can also insert videos from the internet

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:42.008
into your notes.

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:44.008
Find the video you want online,

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:47.007
copy the video URL from the address bar,

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:51.001
and then select where you want it on the page

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:56.007
and paste it.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.008
You can select the link to play the video back

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.005
on the original website,

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.003
or select the Play button on the embedded video

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.005
and watch it right in your notes.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.004
When data needs to be stored and shared in a table,

00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:12.002
you can create one directly in your notebook.

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.001
Adding tables in your notes can also be helpful

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.002
in keeping groups of information together

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.009
and sorted appropriately.

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:26.004
To add a table to your notes, select Insert, then Table.

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:30.001
Next, select how many rows and columns you need.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:35.001
The amount selected will be highlighted.

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:36.004
When you work in a table,

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:39.008
the table menu becomes available in the ribbon.

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:41.006
You can also right click on the table

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:45.007
to have the menu appear.

00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:50.001
Select Table to further customize your table,

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:56.003
like insert or delete rows or columns.

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.004
Sometimes words just don't do enough.

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.002
Adding files, videos,

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.004
and tables helps to add dimension

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:06.002
and further clarification to your notes.

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:09.001
Try adding some pictures or a table to your notes

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:12.000
to help you better explain and organize information.
