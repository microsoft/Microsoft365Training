00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Without pictures, videos and smart art

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.008
presentations can look pretty dull.

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.002
In this lesson you'll learn how to use tools in PowerPoint

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.009
to convey key points and make your presentations pop.

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.006
First open PowerPoint.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.009
You can follow along with the sample presentation

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.006
in your exercise files.

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:23.005
It's called customer event example draft.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:26.005
In this example, I'll be using a presentation

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.005
for a customer event I'm organizing.

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:32.001
To add a picture to this slide of my presentation,

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.002
I'll select insert from the top ribbon,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.008
then pictures.

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:40.004
When I select pictures, a dropdown menu will appear.

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:41.008
I'll choose one of the options.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:45.000
This device allows you to choose a picture

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.005
from your computer.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.009
OneDrive allows you to choose a picture

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.004
from the cloud and your OneDrive.

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:56.000
Stock images are images and icons stored in PowerPoint.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.001
Bing pictures allow you to import pictures

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.007
from the internet by searching for them.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:06.001
I'll add a picture from online by selecting Bing pictures.

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.004
Now an online pictures window will appear.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:13.008
Here you can search for and choose which picture to add.

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:17.001
There are many subcategories for you to search within.

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.009
In the search bar I'll type the word customer

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.007
and enter.

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:31.004
I can use the scroll arrows to search for the best option.

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:32.009
I'll select the picture that I want

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.001
and select insert at the bottom.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.007
Now I can adjust the image.

00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:44.004
Say I want to change the size of the image,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.007
I'll right click the picture

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.003
and an editing options menu will appear.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:52.003
This is where you can use the format picture tools

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:55.002
to crop, change the picture position relative

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:59.002
to the text and see other formatting options.

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:00.004
You can also change the size

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.004
of the picture by selecting the white points

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:06.000
at the corner to resize it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.002
Adding an online video is another option

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.003
to enhance your presentation.

00:02:10.003 --> 00:02:13.009
To add a video from online to your presentation,

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.005
first select the slide where you want the video.

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:23.003
Then go to insert in the top ribbon and select online video.

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.005
A window will appear where you can enter the address

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:29.002
for the online video from YouTube, SlideShare,

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.009
Vimeo, or Stream.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.002
Once you've entered the web address of your video,

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.009
you'll see a preview.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:41.006
Select insert at the bottom of the window.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.004
You can move the video by dragging it

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.009
where you want it to be.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.000
If you want to change the size of the video,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.004
right click the preview

00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:53.002
and an editing options menu will appear.

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.006
You can also change the size of the video

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:59.004
by selecting the white points at the corners to resize it.

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:01.000
Another way to make your presentation pop is

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.006
to add smart art graphics.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.004
To insert a smart art graphic,

00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:09.005
select the slide where you want the smart art graphic.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:14.005
Next select insert from the top ribbon, then smart art.

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:19.006
On the dropdown menu, select your preferred layout.

00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:23.002
When the graphic is inserted on your slide,

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:27.002
a text editor box appears on the left of the graphic.

00:03:27.002 --> 00:03:29.002
Each text bullet item in the editor

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.001
corresponds to one item in the graphic.

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:34.006
To add items, place your cursor next to the bullet

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:40.008
in the text editor box and enter your text.

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:42.009
You can add additional shape to your graphic

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.005
by pressing enter to add another bullet item

00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:51.004
in the text editor.

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:54.008
You can delete shapes by deleting the bullet item

00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:58.009
that you want to remove.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:02.005
Now you're ready to add great visual touches to your slides.

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:06.000
Try using pictures, videos, and smart art graphics

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.004
to make your next presentation pop.
