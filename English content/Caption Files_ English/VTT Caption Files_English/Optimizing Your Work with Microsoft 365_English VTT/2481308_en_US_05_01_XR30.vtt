00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Narrator] It can be frustrating when you're in a meeting

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:05.004
and don't have access to the information you need.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.003
Microsoft Teams allows you to apply settings

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:12.000
so you can have a fluid, productive meeting every time.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.006
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.005
how to manage a team's settings and permissions.

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.003
To get started, I'll open Teams

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:25.001
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.006
Being the owner of the Customer Event team,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.001
I will use this example.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.008
To set general settings, select your profile picture

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:36.006
at the top of the app.

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:42.004
Select Manage account and the Settings window will appear

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:44.004
where you can change app settings,

00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:52.001
notifications, or language.

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.005
Close the Settings window to save any changes.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:01:00.007
Next let's look at the settings related to a specific team.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.000
In this example, I own a team

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.004
related to a customer event I'm planning,

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.002
so I can find the team's name and select the three dots

00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:13.002
for more options, then Manage team.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.006
In the Settings tab,

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.002
I can select or clear the options or permissions

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.001
that I want to use.

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.006
To change the team name, description, or privacy settings,

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.002
I'll go to the team's name

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:30.000
and select the three dots for more options,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.004
then Edit team.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.004
I'll write a description for this team.

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:38.008
I'll write, "This is for the communication

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:44.006
about our upcoming customer event."

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:50.007
When I'm finished, I'll select Done.

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:52.005
If you're not a team owner,

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.006
you are either a member or a guest.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.009
Members are the people in the team.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.003
They talk with other team members in conversation

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:03.008
and can view, upload and change files.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:07.001
Guests are people from outside of your organization

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.007
that a team owner invites,

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.007
such as partners or consultants

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:13.005
who will have limited access.

00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:15.002
Guests have fewer capabilities

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.005
than team members or team owners,

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:22.003
but they can still participate in chat and create channels.

00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:24.003
That's all there is to it.

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.005
Double check your team settings this week

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.005
to make sure that everyone you work with

00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:30.006
has the correct access.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.000
Maybe now is a good time to change your profile picture

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.004
to a great new selfie.
