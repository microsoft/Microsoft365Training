00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.006
- Calls are a great tool for team meetings and quick chats.

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:05.007
It's important to have the right settings

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.005
just in case you miss a call

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to manage

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:12.004
your call settings on Teams.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:14.007
To get started, I'll open Teams

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:21.001
from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.005
Next to your profile picture near the top,

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.008
select the three dots for more options.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:32.004
Then select Settings.

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.008
Now, let's say you'll be out of the office

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:38.001
and you want to forward your incoming calls.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.001
On the left menu, go to Calls

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:49.003
and under Call answering rules, choose Forward my calls

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.001
and Teams will forward all calls directly to your voicemail.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:58.005
If you select Configure voicemail under Voicemail,

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.008
you will be able to record a greeting.

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.001
You can also select how you would like Teams

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:10.000
to handle calls when a caller goes to voicemail.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.008
They can record a message,

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.000
choose to record a message

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.002
or be transferred to someone else,

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:17.007
end the call without playing your greeting,

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.000
play the greeting and end the call,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.007
or just be transferred to someone else of your choosing.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:28.002
If you select Transfer the call to someone else,

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.002
you will need to designate a person

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:32.004
for the call to be transferred to.

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:38.001
I'll select Isaiah.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:39.006
When a caller calls you,

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.004
the call will be transferred to the designated person.

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.003
You can also specify the language for your greeting,

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:49.008
as well as customize a text-to-speech greeting option.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.001
This option allows you to have a written greeting

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.005
and would replace your voicemail.

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.000
Should you want to create a custom

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
out of office text greeting,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.002
place your cursor below where it says

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.006
Your custom out of office greeting

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:07.007
and write your out of office greeting.

00:02:07.007 --> 00:02:10.000
I'll write I'm out of the office.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.009
Feel free to send me an email.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.000
Below it, you can select when your out of office

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.006
custom greeting will display.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.008
Select OK to save your changes.

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:28.003
I encourage you to put the proper settings in place

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.006
to manage your calls so that you can make sure

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.008
all calls are answered according to your availability.

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:34.008
Give it a try.
