00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.001
- Large meetings can often be noisy

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:03.006
and even chaotic.

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:04.008
Creating a breakout room

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:07.002
within a meeting is a great way to create space

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:10.000
for focus work with smaller groups.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.002
In this lesson,

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:12.003
I'll show you how to create

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.006
and manage breakout rooms in your Teams meetings.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.008
In this example,

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.007
I'll create and manage breakout rooms

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:22.000
for a customer event my team is managing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Please note that the breakout rooms can only be managed

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.009
from the Teams desktop app.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.000
To get started,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.007
I'll go to my Teams calendar and join a Teams meeting

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:40.005
that I have created from the meeting invitation.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:46.005
Next I'll select the breakout rooms icon on the top menu.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:50.001
Then I'll choose the number of rooms I want to create.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.008
I can create up to 50 rooms per meeting.

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.009
Two is enough for this meeting.

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:56.000
From here,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.002
I need to assign attendees to rooms by adding participants.

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.001
I can have Teams evenly assign people

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.009
to rooms automatically,

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:08.007
or I can assign people to rooms myself manually.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.002
I'll select automatically

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.005
and Teams will add attendees to rooms

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.006
as they join the meeting.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:19.008
Then select Create rooms.

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.009
The rooms are created but not open.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.006
With the breakout room set up,

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.009
let's keep them organized

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.005
and well managed by appointing breakout room managers,

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.001
naming the breakout rooms,

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.006
setting a time limit for breakout room sessions

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.006
and closing them.

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.007
To appoint a breakout room manager,

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:42.006
select room settings.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:48.008
And switch the Assign presenters to manage rooms toggle on.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:53.003
Next select Search for presenters,

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:58.008
and choose who you want to be breakout room managers.

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.008
To keep your meetings on schedule,

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:01.009
you can use time limits

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.002
that automatically close breakout rooms

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.006
after the required length.

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:11.000
Turn the Set a time limit toggle on

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.009
and choose a session length.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.004
Once you've finished,

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:21.004
select the back button next to the Settings heading

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:25.005
to save your changes.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.000
If you have multiple breakout rooms at once,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.008
you can keep them organized by renaming them.

00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:33.000
To rename a breakout room,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.009
select more options next

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:39.005
to the breakout room that you would like to rename.

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:45.006
When the dropdown menu appears, select Rename.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:50.007
I'll name this room Group A

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:56.009
then select Rename.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:06.004
And this second one, Group B.

00:03:06.004 --> 00:03:08.005
Make sure to open the breakout rooms

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:15.006
after the attendees have been added.

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.001
At the end of small group time in your meeting,

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:20.008
you can close out the breakout rooms.

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:23.001
To close rooms individually,

00:03:23.001 --> 00:03:27.004
select more options.

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:29.000
If you want to close all rooms

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
at the same time, select close.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.009
You will know the rooms have been successfully closed

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.009
when their status changes to closed.

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.006
Breakout rooms are great for creating spaces

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:49.002
within existing meetings to give small groups time to meet

00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:51.005
before rejoining the larger group.

00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:53.001
See where you can add breakout rooms

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:54.005
in your upcoming meetings.
