00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Educator] The meeting was scheduled,

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.001
the attendees have arrived,

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.004
and now it's time to present.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:06.003
In this lesson,

00:00:06.003 --> 00:00:08.002
I'll show you how to present in Teams

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.008
directly from PowerPoint by sharing your screen or windows

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.006
and by requesting and taking control from another presenter.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.005
In this example,

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:19.002
I want to share a presentation

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:24.004
on the progress my team is making on a key customer event.

00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:26.006
First, I'll join a Teams meeting

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:27.009
to show you how to present

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:38.007
using the Present in Teams feature.

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:43.007
From here, I'll open my presentation in PowerPoint.

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:49.006
Select Present in the top right corner of PowerPoint.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:59.002
And in the dropdown menu, select Present in Teams.

00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:01.006
Your presentation will appear in Microsoft Teams

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.005
for you and all your attendees.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.005
When you're done presenting,

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:15.005
select Stop Presenting at the top of the Teams' screen.

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.006
Next, I'll show you how to share your screen

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:19.006
in a Teams meeting.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.003
In my Teams meeting, I'll select the Share Content icon

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:24.003
at the top right of the screen

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:29.002
and then choose what I want to share.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:33.002
Screen lets you show everything on your screen.

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:35.002
PowerPoint Live lets you share

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.009
recently opened PowerPoint presentations.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.003
Window lets you share an open window,

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:45.004
like a specific app or document that you have open.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:52.009
I'll share a window and select my open Excel document.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.000
After you select what you want to share,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
a red border surrounds what you are sharing.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.007
To stop sharing, select the stop sharing icon

00:02:00.007 --> 00:02:04.007
indicated by an X in the minimized Teams video

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:08.007
in the lower right corner of your screen

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:17.004
or at the top of the screen where it says Stop Presenting.

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:18.003
Sometimes during a meeting

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.001
you'll need another participant to share,

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:24.001
Teams lets you give control to other participants.

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:26.006
When you give control to another participant,

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:29.000
you will both be in control of sharing,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.003
but you can take back control anytime.

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:39.000
I'll share my Excel document again.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.004
To let someone else control

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:41.007
while you're sharing your screen,

00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:45.006
go to the sharing toolbar at the top,

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:49.002
and select Give Control.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:55.005
Select the name of the attendee you want to give control to.

00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:58.001
And Teams sends a notification to that participant

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.002
to let them know you're sharing control.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:03.004
Note, only users logged into Teams

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:07.005
will be able to both request and give control.

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:08.007
While you're sharing control,

00:03:08.007 --> 00:03:11.008
they can make selections, edits, and other modifications

00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:14.003
to the shared screen.

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:19.008
To take back control, select Cancel Control at the top.

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:21.008
If a participant wants to take control

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:23.003
while another person is sharing,

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:27.000
they'll select Request Control at the top of the window.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.003
The person sharing can then approve or deny your request.

00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:35.003
While they have control,

00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:37.004
they can make selections, edits,

00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:41.001
and other modifications to the shared screen.

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.002
When you're done, select Cancel Control

00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:47.004
to stop sharing control.

00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:53.005
That's teamwork making the dream work.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:56.002
Using Presenter mode can help you become a more engaging

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.004
and integral part of your presentation

00:03:58.004 --> 00:04:04.001
instead of sharing screen or window content only.

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.007
In the upper right corner of Teams,

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:08.009
select Share Content to see Presenter modes

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.000
and other options.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.002
Under Presenter mode, choose the mode that you want.

00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:17.000
Stand out,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.007
where your live image is in front of the presentation,

00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:23.005
side by side, where your live image is framed

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:26.000
next to the presentation,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.008
or reporter, where your live image is over a background

00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:33.001
and the shared content is over your shoulder.

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:34.000
In Reporter mode,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.003
your image appears bigger than the shared content.

00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:40.001
If you're ready to start your presentation,

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.009
make sure your camera is on,

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.004
select the presentation mode,

00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:47.008
and choose a screen or window on your device when prompted.

00:04:47.008 --> 00:04:48.006
There are lots of options

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:50.003
for you to deliver engaging content

00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:53.009
in your presentations and meetings with Teams,

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.000
try using some of these features in your next large meeting.
