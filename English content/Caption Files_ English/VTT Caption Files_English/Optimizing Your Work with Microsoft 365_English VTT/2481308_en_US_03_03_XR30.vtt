00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Animations and transitions

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.006
are key tools to make your presentations flow.

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.008
In this lesson, I'll show you how to apply animations

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.001
to different elements and set transitions

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:14.008
between slides that support, not distract the presentation.

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:16.008
First, open PowerPoint.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.001
You can follow along with the sample presentation

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.008
in your exercise files,

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:25.001
it's called customer event example A.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.003
In this example,

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:27.006
I'll be using a presentation

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.003
for a customer event I'm organizing.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:32.001
To add a transition to your slide,

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.003
open the slide where you want a transition.

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:38.000
The transition will begin on the proceeding slide

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.001
and conclude on the slide you select.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.003
Next, go to the transitions tab in the top ribbon

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:47.008
and find the effect that you want in the transition gallery.

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:51.000
To see more options, select the dropdown menu.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.001
I'll select morph.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.009
After you've chosen your transition,

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.008
select the options tab next to the transition gallery

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.004
to specify how the transition occurs.

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.009
I'll select objects.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.002
To set how fast a transition goes,

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:10.000
enter a time in the duration box next to the options tab.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.001
I'll enter one second.

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.002
If you want all slides in the presentation

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:19.004
to transition in the same way, select apply to all.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:21.006
If you want to see the transition in action,

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:26.006
select the slideshow icon in the lower right corner.

00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.001
To remove a transition,

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.006
select none in the transition gallery,

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.004
or select apply to all

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:37.000
if you want to get rid of all the transitions.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.007
If you want to remove only one transition,

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:43.000
remember that a transition applies to a slide's entrance,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.007
not how it exits.

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.009
So if you want to remove the exit effects for a slide,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.003
remove the transition from the slide after.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:52.005
Animations are another way

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.007
to add interest to your presentation.

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:56.001
To add an animation,

00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.004
select the object or text on the slide

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:00.006
that you want to animate.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:05.005
Next, go to the animations tab in the top ribbon.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:10.002
Open the animations gallery and select the one you want.

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:11.007
On the animations tab,

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.003
open the effect options list

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:17.001
and select from the available options.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.005
Effect options are available for text

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.000
or for choosing the direction or intensity of an animation.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Not all animations have effect options.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.007
To preview the animation,

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:29.006
on the slideshow tab of the ribbon

00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:32.003
select play from the beginning.

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:33.008
When in slideshow view,

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:35.006
navigate through the slides

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:39.009
to make an animation effect play.

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:41.008
To remove an animation effect,

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.005
select the animated object or text,

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:47.007
then in the animations tab in the top ribbon

00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:51.004
open the animations gallery and select none.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.000
Adding motion to your presentation

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.009
through animation and transitions

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.009
is a great skill to make your presentations pop.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.002
Try adding an animation and transition

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:01.007
to your next presentation.
