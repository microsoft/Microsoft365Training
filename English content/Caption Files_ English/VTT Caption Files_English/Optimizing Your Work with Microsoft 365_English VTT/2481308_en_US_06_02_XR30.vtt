00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.007
- [Instructor] Need to send a mass communication?

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.007
Mail merges are particularly valuable

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.002
when you're sending an email to multiple people

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:09.008
with individualized messages.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.001
In this lesson,

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.009
I'm going to walk you through a step by step process

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.007
to send a mail merge using Word, Outlook,

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.005
and spreadsheets in Excel.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.007
The process starts with the main document.

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.006
You'll add recipients, add fields to the document

00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.006
so mail merge can individualize your email message,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.001
and then send.

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.001
Please note that the mail merge feature

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.009
is only available in the desktop version

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:39.005
and the step by step Mail Merge Wizard only appears on a PC.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.009
You can follow along with the sample Word document

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:44.000
in your exercise files.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.009
It's called practice mail merge document.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.009
In this example, I'm going to send a reminder email

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:53.001
to attendees for a customer event.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.007
With the document open,

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:57.007
go to the mailings tab on the top ribbon of the screen

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:03.006
and select Start Mail Merge.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.003
Then in the dropdown menu,

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:10.005
select Step by Step Mail Merge Wizard.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.008
This takes you through the steps

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:15.002
of sending a mail merge one step at a time.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.001
Next, select the type of document you're working on

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:23.001
and email,

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:28.007
then select Next: Starting Document.

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.007
In the next step, the wizard lets you start from a template

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.005
or an existing document.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.005
Select Use the current document,

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.007
which is already open and ready.

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:42.001
Select Next: Select recipients.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.000
You can use a list generated from Outlook, Excel,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.004
or generate a new list write in Word.

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:51.007
For this example, I drafted a contact list in Excel,

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.009
follow along by downloading the list in the exercise file.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.002
It's called email contact list example.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:02.005
Select Use an existing list.

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.000
When you select this option,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.005
you also need to select which contacts to use,

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.009
so select Browse.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:18.004
Navigate to your contact list and select Open.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.004
Confirm the table sheet to use,

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.007
select Okay,

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:26.000
verify that the list was imported correctly,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.001
and select Okay again.

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:37.006
Then select Next: Write your email message.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.004
Place your cursor where you want the information

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:40.007
to go in the message

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.005
and select the information type in the wizard panel.

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:45.003
For example, place your cursor

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.000
where you want the greeting line to go

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.006
and select Greeting Line.

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.006
In the insert greeting line window,

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.008
You can select the format of the greeting line

00:02:56.008 --> 00:03:00.009
such as salutation, name format, and more.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.004
If the recipient's name in the list is missing,

00:03:03.004 --> 00:03:06.000
Word replaces it with a generic greeting.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.002
I'll change this to, To whom it may concern.

00:03:14.002 --> 00:03:15.006
In the preview box,

00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:18.001
you can use the arrows to go through the contacts

00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:27.006
to see how each greeting will appear.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:31.006
When you're done, select Okay.

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:33.005
And Word inserts the merge field,

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:37.000
which appears as text between two arrows.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.001
Now you can add more merge fields

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:47.007
or move on and select Next: Preview your email messages.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:50.004
Word temporarily replaces the merge field

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:52.004
with entries from the recipient list

00:03:52.004 --> 00:03:54.009
so you can preview how each email will look

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:56.006
before it's sent.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.002
This is especially helpful

00:03:58.002 --> 00:04:01.009
if your email contains a lot of merge fields.

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.001
Once you've reviewed how each email will look,

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.007
select Next: Complete the mail merge.

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:11.005
You're almost ready to send out the mass email.

00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:15.006
Select Electronic Mail.

00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:17.009
Add a subject line.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:26.008
I'll add Customer Appreciation Day.

00:04:26.008 --> 00:04:32.002
And select Okay when you're ready to send them.

00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:33.009
You're all set.

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:35.008
Once you have all the appropriate settings

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:37.000
and fields in place,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.009
mail merge can help you communicate quickly

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.003
to large groups while still customizing each message.

00:04:42.003 --> 00:04:43.002
Try it the next time

00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:45.002
you have to send out mass communications.
