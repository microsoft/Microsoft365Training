00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] In the workplace, a disorganized presentation

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.009
with unclear messaging can cause confusion.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.004
Creating presentations that are easily understood

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:10.006
by your stakeholders is imperative

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.006
to communicate your message.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:13.008
In this lesson,

00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:16.007
I'll show you how to build a presentation in PowerPoint

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:19.006
and use formatting tools and design elements

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.009
to help make your key data points clear.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.003
First, open PowerPoint.

00:00:25.003 --> 00:00:26.009
Download the sample presentation

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.007
in your exercise files to follow along.

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:36.003
It's called Customer Event Example Draft.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.005
In this example,

00:00:37.005 --> 00:00:40.002
I'm building a presentation for a customer event.

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:41.003
The first thing I want to do

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.008
is select a theme for my presentation,

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.008
so I'll select Design at the top ribbon.

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:50.007
Here, I'm given options for various themes.

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:54.004
I can open the dropdown menu to see more options.

00:00:54.004 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm going to select this one called Office Theme

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.007
and you can see that the theme applies

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.005
to all the slides in my presentation.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.004
If I hover to the right of a theme options,

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.000
I see different variants offered for the current theme.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.003
Selecting the dropdown menu allows you to see more options.

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:17.001
I'll select variant four.

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.003
In Design, you can also insert a background image.

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:22.009
I'll select the background dropdown menu

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.004
where I can see the options for solid fill or picture.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.003
I'll select solid fill and choose a color.

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.008
I can also apply the current slide background

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.000
to all slides at once.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.001
I want all my slides to have the same look,

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.008
so I'm going to select Apply To All.

00:01:42.008 --> 00:01:47.006
I can also use the Designer indicated by the paint brush.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.002
The Designer suggests professional designs

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:51.008
and eye catching visuals

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:54.003
to support the presentation content.

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:56.002
I can use this by adding new texts

00:01:56.002 --> 00:01:58.003
or pictures to a new slide

00:01:58.003 --> 00:02:01.006
and review layouts suggested by Designer.

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:04.002
Now that all my slides have the same format,

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.002
I'm going to organize them into sections.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.009
To add sections to the presentation,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.004
I'll select View from the top ribbon,

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.002
then select Slides Order.

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:15.002
Next, I'll select the first slide

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.007
in the new section that I want to create.

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.001
I'll right-click it and in the dropdown menu,

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.005
choose Add Section.

00:02:22.005 --> 00:02:27.006
I'll give this section a name, Introduction,

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.001
and press Enter.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.008
If I want to rename or remove a section,

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll right-click the section name

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.008
and choose Rename or Remove from the dropdown menu.

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.003
I can also drag slides

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.009
to rearrange the order of the presentation.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.005
Once done, I can return to the original view

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:48.006
by selecting Normal in the menu below the top ribbon.

00:02:48.006 --> 00:02:50.000
Slide numbers can help keep

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.005
the presentation order organized.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.001
To add slide numbers to your presentation,

00:02:55.001 --> 00:03:00.001
go to the top ribbon and select Insert, then Footer.

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:03.006
In the dropdown menu, select the slide number.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:06.001
A menu will appear on the right side of the screen.

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.005
Here I can choose if the title slide should

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.001
or shouldn't have a slide number.

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.009
I'll select don't show on the title slide,

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:19.005
then select Apply All and close the menu.

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.009
Check out the new slide numbers

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.003
in the bottom right corner of each slide

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:25.008
after the title slide.

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:27.008
Formatting PowerPoint presentations

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.005
will keep your PowerPoint organized and easy to understand.

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:33.009
Give it a try and see how these tools

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.009
can help your presentation shine.
