00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Depending on the audience

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:03.006
and your familiarity with the content,

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:07.002
creating a presentation can be a nerve-wracking experience.

00:00:07.002 --> 00:00:08.006
Is this the right info?

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.006
Is that the right format to use?

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.002
Thankfully PowerPoint can take away some of these questions

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.003
and make presentation creation a breeze.

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:20.009
In this lesson, I'm going to share some best practices

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.001
so that you can become a better presenter

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.000
and deliver a clear message in every presentation you give.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.002
To start I'm going to open a PowerPoint presentation.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.002
You can follow along

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.001
with the sample presentation in your exercise files.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.006
It's called customer event example A.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:42.009
First consider what style and font to use.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.008
You want to make sure

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:47.001
that your audience will be able to read from a distance.

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.008
I recommend using a font style that is not too decorative

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.009
in a size between 20 and 24 point.

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.001
To adjust the font and style size, I'll navigate

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.001
to the top ribbon and make sure home is selected.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:06.003
From here I'll highlight the text in the slide

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.003
and select the font

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:13.000
and size from the dropdown menu in the home tab.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Next use bullet points

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.004
and short sentences to share your information.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.005
A minimal amount of text on your slide is the way to go

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.006
to keep your audience engaged.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:27.000
I recommend that each idea should fit on one line.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.008
To emphasize points and help tell a story, use pictures,

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.006
graphics, charts, and graphs.

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.002
Be sure to add labels to help your audience

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:39.006
identify the purpose of the visual elements.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.007
It's also important to keep backgrounds subtle and uniform.

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.007
Keeping your background colors subtle will help

00:01:45.007 --> 00:01:49.001
your audience focus on the points in the presentation.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.005
To edit your background

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.005
navigate to the design tab and select background.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:58.007
A solid fill is usually the least distracting.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:02.005
Next, use themes to set a high contrast

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.005
between the background color and the text color.

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:06.008
To change your theme

00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:09.002
open your existing PowerPoint presentation,

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:11.006
navigate to design in the top ribbon,

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:14.003
and select a theme from the dropdown menu.

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:15.003
I also recommend

00:02:15.003 --> 00:02:17.004
that you use the accessibility checker.

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.007
Navigate to the top ribbon, select review,

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.004
and then check accessibility.

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.007
PowerPoint will give you tips to address any errors

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:29.000
that might make it hard for anyone to view.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Next, use the presenter coach

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.006
to practice your presentation delivery.

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:35.007
To access the presenter coach

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.007
go to the slideshow tab in the top ribbon

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.005
and select rehearse with coach.

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.004
When your presentation appears,

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:49.002
you can practice your delivery by selecting start rehearsal.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.009
After you finish the rehearsal report will give you

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.009
information like your pace, pronunciation, pitch,

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.008
and time spent to support you as you work

00:02:58.008 --> 00:03:03.006
to perfect your presentation skills and style.

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.005
Next, use your notes.

00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:06.005
Don't just read the text on the slides word for word.

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:11.002
Practice what you'll say about the key points

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:14.007
so you don't get confused or miss any relevant information

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:16.005
while you're presenting.

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:18.006
To add notes to your presentation

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:24.005
navigate to the view tab in the top ribbon and select notes.

00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:27.004
Now go forth and practice your presentation.
