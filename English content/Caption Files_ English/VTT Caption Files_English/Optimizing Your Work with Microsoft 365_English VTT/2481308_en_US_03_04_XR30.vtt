00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Sometimes the best way to share information

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.009
in a presentation is through data.

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.000
In this lesson, I'll show you how to add Excel charts,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.008
create and format tables,

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.006
and add flow charts to your presentations.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:15.003
First, I'll show you how to add an Excel chart

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:17.002
to a PowerPoint presentation.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.002
A chart is a tool that you can use

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.009
to communicate data graphically.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.007
To start, I'll open Excel.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.001
Follow along by downloading

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.006
the sample worksheet exercise file.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:32.006
It's called Example PowerPoint Data.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.002
So here in my Excel worksheet,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.001
I have a nicely formatted chart.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.006
I want to use it as is in my presentation,

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:42.000
so I'll take the chart and insert it into my presentation.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.006
I'll right click this chart and select copy.

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:48.008
Next, I'll open the presentation in PowerPoint.

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:50.001
Follow along by downloading

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.005
the sample PowerPoint exercise file.

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:56.009
It's called Customer Event Example (A).

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.005
I will then right click the slide where

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.007
I want to display the chart and select paste.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.000
I can then resize the chart to fit appropriately

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.008
in the slide.

00:01:08.008 --> 00:01:12.008
You can also do this with a table you formatted in Excel.

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:16.000
Now you might not always have data in Excel ready to go.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.003
So next I want to show you how to add and format a table

00:01:19.003 --> 00:01:21.002
right in PowerPoint.

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:22.006
A table is used to manage

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.002
and analyze a group of related data.

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:29.003
To start, I'll select the slide where I want to add a table.

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.002
I'll go to the top ribbon and select insert.

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:34.001
Then table.

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.005
In the dropdown grid,

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.002
I'll use the cursor to select the number

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.005
of rows and columns that I need.

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.007
And an empty table is added to the slide.

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:46.002
From here I can add text to the table

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:55.007
by selecting a cell and typing directly in it.

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.001
I can also change the formatting

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:59.004
of the table by right clicking on it

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:06.002
and choosing from the editing options in the menu.

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.002
If a table doesn't illustrate your data,

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.005
perhaps a flow chart is a better visual to include

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.001
in your presentation.

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:16.009
A flow chart is a diagram that shows a process or workflow.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:26.003
To start, I'll add a blank slide.

00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:30.000
From here I'll go to the insert tab in the top ribbon,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.009
then select smart art.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.005
From the dropdown menu

00:02:34.005 --> 00:02:38.009
in the process section, I'll select a process flow chart.

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:43.008
I like this one, basic chevron process.

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:46.001
After the flow chart is added to the slide,

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:50.000
a text editor box appears to the left of the chart.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'll type the text for my chart in the text editor box

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:07.008
and watch the text appear in the chart graphic.

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:10.001
No matter what type of chart or table you add,

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.000
displaying your data in an easy to read way makes

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.001
for a compelling and consistent presentation.

00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.007
How about adding a table or chart

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:20.005
to your next presentation to share your data?

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.008
I'm sure you'll get a positive response.
