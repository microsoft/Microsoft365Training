00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.001
- [Instructor] There's lots of factors

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.001
to consider when hosting a large meeting.

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.007
How many people will attend,

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.004
what tools guests need to have access to.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.001
How will the presenters deliver the information?

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.003
Teams makes facilitating large meetings easy.

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:15.005
In this lesson,

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:18.009
I'll show you how to set settings for your large meetings.

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.004
I'll start in Teams on the desktop.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:23.009
Please note that certain organizer features

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.005
are only available in the desktop version.

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.001
As the meeting organizer,

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.000
it's important to check your meeting options

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
before your meeting starts.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.001
First, go to your Teams calendar

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:36.006
and select the upcoming meeting

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:42.006
that you're the organizer for.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:49.004
Next to the time zone dropdown menu, select Meeting Options.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:54.008
Here, you can set lobby, present, mike,

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.003
camera, chat, and reaction settings.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.003
First, you'll want to set your lobby settings by navigating

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:04.000
to who can bypass the lobby.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.007
The lobby is a waiting area for meeting attendees

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:08.007
before a meeting starts.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.000
In the dropdown menu,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.008
you can select who will wait in the lobby

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:16.004
or allow meeting attendees to bypass the lobby.

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:21.005
I'm going to select people in my organization and guests.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:25.000
Next, you'll want to identify who can present

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.004
in the meeting.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.003
On the right, you can select presenters

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.000
by selecting who can present

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.006
and select from everyone,

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:36.001
people in my organization and guests,

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.000
specific people, or only me.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.004
I'm going to select Everyone.

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:43.008
When you select the attendees

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:45.009
who will be presenting at the meeting,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.004
keep in mind that presenters can promote other attendees

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.001
to the presenter role during the meeting.

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.007
Now, not every a attend needs to interact

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:56.009
and speak in large meetings.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.007
In those situations, you can disallow mikes

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:02.000
for the large group.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.004
In the meeting options,

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:09.006
switch the Allow Mike For Attendees toggle to No.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.007
If someone needs to interact during the meeting,

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.009
you can change their role later.

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.002
In a large meeting,

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:19.007
not every a attend needs to have their camera on either.

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.000
In the meeting options,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.007
switch the Allow Camera For Attendees toggle to No.

00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:29.002
At appropriate times during the meeting,

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.007
video can be permitted for an individual attendee

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.003
or all attendees.

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.002
When you're done making changes

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.009
to all of these meeting settings,

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:44.000
select Save and close the window.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.001
Now I want to show you how to change settings

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.000
during the meeting.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.006
To start, I'll join the meeting.

00:02:56.006 --> 00:02:58.004
If you've started a meeting

00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:00.005
and you're waiting for attendees to arrive,

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:06.005
you can select Show Participants indicated by a people icon,

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:15.000
select their name and select Request To Join.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.008
They'll receive a notification similar

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.005
to a regular Teams call asking them to join the meeting.

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.006
You can also enter a person's name

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:25.003
or phone number in the search box to add someone

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:28.008
to the meeting who was not previously invited.

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.003
Once the meeting has started,

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.009
you can choose up to seven people's video feeds

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.002
to spotlight for everyone else.

00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:36.006
Spotlighting a video

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.009
is like pinning it for everyone in the meeting.

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.003
You can spotlight a video by identifying

00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:43.005
the person in the list

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.001
whose video you want to highlight,

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.002
right-click on their name,

00:03:49.002 --> 00:03:55.003
and select Spotlight For Everyone.

00:03:55.003 --> 00:03:57.002
When you're ready to end the spotlight,

00:03:57.002 --> 00:04:05.000
right click again, and choose Stop Spotlighting.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.005
To spotlight your own video, right click on your name

00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:16.004
and select Spotlight For Everyone.

00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:20.007
Because after all, you too are a star.

00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:22.002
Preparing for a large meeting

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:24.007
by setting your meeting settings ahead of time

00:04:24.007 --> 00:04:27.001
will ensure that you have all the functionality needed

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:28.008
to have an efficient meeting

00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:30.009
and that you can make adjustments easily

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.009
once the meeting has started.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.007
Try adjusting your settings before and during a meeting.
