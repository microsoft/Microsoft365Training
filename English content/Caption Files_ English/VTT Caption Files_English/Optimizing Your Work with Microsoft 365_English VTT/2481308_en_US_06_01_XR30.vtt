00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.004
- [Instructor] Have you ever had to send out

00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:03.009
a mass communication, but wanted to customize

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.009
sections of the message for each recipient?

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.007
Mail merge allows you to send out individualized messages

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.004
to many recipients.

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.001
It can auto-fill names in the text

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:17.001
using a data source, like a list, spreadsheet, or database,

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:18.009
so recipients feel like it was addressed

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.006
specifically to them.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.009
In this lesson, I'll walk you through what a mail merge is

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.003
and why it's so valuable.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.000
Placeholders, known as merge fields,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.001
tell Microsoft Word where in the document

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.002
to include information from the data source.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.002
You build the main document in Word,

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.008
inserting merge fields for the personalized content

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.003
you want to include.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.002
When the mail merge is complete,

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:46.001
Word will generate a personalized version of the document

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.009
for each entry in the data source.

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:51.006
Using a mail merge can take time to set up,

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.008
but saves time and energy in the long run.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.002
Mail merge is only available

00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:00.004
on the desktop application feature, not on the web version.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:02.009
It works in conjunction with Outlook and Excel

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.002
for desktop as well.

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:08.001
Consider updating your Microsoft 365 account

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.000
to be one with access to the desktop applications,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.005
so you'll always have access to the mail merge feature.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.003
Mail merge is a time-saving tool

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:19.009
that will help you create mass communications with ease.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.008
Try it out.
