00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Educator] Referring to specific resources in a document

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:04.003
can take up a lot of space.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.005
With footnotes, you can keep your references organized

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.004
and easy to read.

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:10.006
In this lesson,

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:13.002
I'm going to show you how to reference your content in Word

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:16.004
with footnotes and adding a table of contents.

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.000
Footnotes are used to explain, comment on,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.005
or provide references to something in a document.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.005
A table of contents helps you to locate specific information

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.005
in a document.

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:28.005
To get started,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:32.000
I'll open Word from the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.002
You can follow along with the sample Word document

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.000
in your exercise files,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.003
it's called Customer Event Product Document.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:43.008
In this example, I'll be editing a product document

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.007
from a customer event I'm organizing.

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.008
First, I'll add footnotes.

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:51.006
Footnotes are citations that appear at the footer

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.003
or the bottom of the page.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:54.006
Once a footnote has been added,

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:58.003
you'll have a small superscript number after the cited text

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.007
and the full citation on the page's footer.

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:02.007
To insert a footnote,

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:04.001
I'll place my cursor

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.002
to the right of the text I want to cite.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.006
From here, I'll navigate to the top ribbon,

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:14.006
select References, and then Insert Footnote.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.006
At this point, a window appears where I can specify

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.000
the details of the original work I'm citing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll enter St. Clair Housen "To Be A Mogul"

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.002
Chapter 3, Page 46, Line 22.

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.009
This is the first footnote I'm adding to the document.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.002
So the number one is in the box.

00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:34.009
Press the Escape button on your keyboard,

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.009
or select the body of the document

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.005
to save and close the footnote.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.005
When I'm in editing view,

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:44.003
I can't see the citation at the bottom of the page,

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.009
but the footnote will be there.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:52.008
If I select the number, I can edit the footnote details.

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.002
To see how the footnote appears in your document,

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.003
I need to be in reading view.

00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.007
Navigate to the top ribbon, select View,

00:01:59.007 --> 00:02:03.006
then select Reading View.

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:06.007
Now, when I scroll through the document,

00:02:06.007 --> 00:02:12.003
I can see that the footnotes are at the bottom of the page.

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:17.005
Now, I'll select the Edit Document tab in the top ribbon

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:22.001
and then choose Edit.

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:24.002
Word will send you back to editing view

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.008
where you can continue editing.

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.007
If a footnote is not the citation method you want to use,

00:02:29.007 --> 00:02:31.001
consider an end note,

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.007
which adds the footer text to the end of the document

00:02:33.007 --> 00:02:36.005
instead of the bottom of the page.

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:39.007
Navigate to the top ribbon, select References,

00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:42.004
and then Insert End Note.

00:02:42.004 --> 00:02:44.004
Another way to keep your document organized

00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:48.007
is to add a table of contents.

00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:50.007
Before you create a table of contents,

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:54.005
you need to select your texts and apply a heading.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:56.003
Word uses the headings in your document

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:58.007
to build an automatic table of contents

00:02:58.007 --> 00:03:02.007
that can be updated when you change the heading text,

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:04.007
sequence, or level.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:09.001
Highlight the text you wish to apply a heading to,

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.001
then navigate to the Home tab,

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.007
and in the style galleries, select the heading choice

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:18.009
and the text automatically takes that heading form.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.002
If you have subheadings,

00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:22.005
select different texts that you would like to have

00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:37.007
under the first heading and apply a different style to it.

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:41.002
Now you're ready to create and add your table of contents.

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:42.006
Now place your cursor

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:44.008
where you want to insert the table of contents.

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.006
I usually place it near the beginning of the document

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:51.003
or after a title page.

00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:56.007
On the top ribbon, select References.

00:03:56.007 --> 00:04:01.002
Next, select Table of Contents.

00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:06.004
In the dropdown menu, choose Insert Table of Contents.

00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:08.004
If you make changes to your document

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:10.000
that affect the table of contents,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.006
you can update it by selecting the table

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:14.008
and selecting the update box that appears

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:17.005
to the left of the table of contents.

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:19.004
Adding references as footnotes

00:04:19.004 --> 00:04:20.008
and creating a table of contents

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:23.003
is a great way of elevating your documents.

00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:27.001
Try adding these reference forms to your next document.
