00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Whether you're working on a project

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.006
or communicating with a new team,

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.009
information and contacts can quickly become disorganized

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:08.007
if you don't manage them.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.006
The good news is there is an easy way

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.004
to automate your organization,

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.008
keeping all related information together.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.004
In this lesson, I'm going to share techniques

00:00:18.004 --> 00:00:22.000
so that you can optimize and maintain your Outlook inbox

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.005
more effectively.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.006
First, I want to show you how to create folders.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.006
Folders bring structure to your inbox

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:33.001
and allow relevant information to be stored together.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:34.007
You can use folders to organize

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:39.009
your emails, calendars, tasks, and reorganize messages.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.009
So first I'll start on the Microsoft 365 homepage.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm going to open my Outlook.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.004
Here I am in my inbox.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.008
In this example, I'm going to adjust my Outlook inbox

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.009
by using folders to keep information

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:58.001
about an upcoming event organized.

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.008
To create a folder in Outlook

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.004
on the left side, under the Folders drop-down,

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.001
select New folder.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:06.007
Enter a name for the new folder

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.006
that makes sense for what you'll be using it for.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:14.009
I'll call this folder Upcoming Event.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.007
So now I've created an easily accessible place

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:21.002
where I can organize any messages related to this event.

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.001
To move messages to a folder,

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.004
select and drag the emails into the folder.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.001
To move more than one email,

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.006
select the circle on the top left corner of the email.

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.004
When you make these selections,

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:36.005
an option menu on the right appears.

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.008
Select the Move drop-down menu,

00:01:38.008 --> 00:01:43.003
and select the folder that you want to move the emails to.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.005
Talk about efficiency.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:48.005
Next, I want to show you how to use contact lists

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.003
to keep you organized.

00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:53.003
A contact list is a collection of email addresses

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:56.006
you can use to send emails to a group of people.

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:58.005
To create a contact list,

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.003
I'll navigate to the People page,

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:04.003
using the toolbar on the left side.

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:09.000
Then select your contact lists under the Contacts drop-down.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.002
Next, select the plus next to Create a contact list.

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.008
Contact lists are created in the default contacts folder,

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.007
and under All Contact lists.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:23.009
If you want to save the contact list in a different folder,

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.002
select the folder before you select New contact list.

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.003
Enter name for the list.

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll call this one, Customer Event Attendees.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.008
And then add your contacts, information,

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:38.005
names, email addresses,

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:41.000
and any other important information.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.007
One row at a time pressing Enter after each entry.

00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:49.007
Then I'll select Create.

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:52.007
To adjust which people are included in your contact list,

00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:59.009
navigate to the People page and select contact lists.

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.003
To adjust which people are included in your contact list,

00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:06.009
select Edit.

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.003
From here you can either enter more names

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:11.001
or email addresses to add people

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:13.009
or remove people by selecting the X,

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.003
next to their name or email address.

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:19.005
Once you've made your edits, select Save.

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:21.009
Now that a contact list is created,

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.001
you can send emails to the full group

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.005
without having to type each name individually.

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.006
Creating folders helps you organize your inbox,

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.003
but you can keep your inbox even more organized

00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:35.004
by setting up rules.

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:36.009
Rules allow you to move

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:40.007
and respond to email messages automatically.

00:03:40.007 --> 00:03:42.002
For example,

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:45.000
if I wanted to move a message from one of my colleagues

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.001
into the Upcoming Events folder,

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:49.005
I can just right-click on one of those messages,

00:03:49.005 --> 00:03:53.005
select Advanced actions, then Create rule.

00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:59.000
I'll select More options and a condition.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.009
In this case for all messages from Lynne Robbins,

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:06.001
I will select the drop-down for Select an action,

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.009
and choose Move to.

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.009
In the Select a folder drop-down,

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.007
select the folder I created for my event.

00:04:13.007 --> 00:04:18.005
To use the rule right away, select the Run rule now box.

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:23.002
Then select Save.

00:04:23.002 --> 00:04:27.001
The message from my colleague now appears in that folder.

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.003
By using these tools and putting rules in place,

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:31.002
you can organize

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:34.000
all your messages and contacts in your inbox

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.008
quickly and efficiently.

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:38.007
Try setting up some rules and lists,

00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:41.006
and see how well you can streamline your email workflow.
