00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] And now we've reached the end of this course,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.005
but it's not the end of your journey.

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.008
There will always be new things to learn

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:09.006
and new ways to build efficiency.

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.005
I want to leave you with some resources

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.005
that will help you along your way.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.006
First, I recommend that you check out

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.009
the Microsoft Community page and join the conversation.

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.009
The Microsoft Community is a great place

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.009
to find quick tips and solutions

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.006
to typical issues that you encounter.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:27.005
You can ask questions of the support team

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.004
as well as speak to other users just like you.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:34.002
And lastly, explore the products and make mistakes.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:35.008
It's only through making mistakes

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:37.006
that you can learn how to troubleshoot

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.000
and solve problems on your own.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.007
I know that you have the ability and skill

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.006
to achieve anything you set your mind to.

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.003
Thanks for watching this course.

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:47.004
I wish you the best

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:51.000
as you learn new avenues for navigating your own success

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.002
and building the career that you want and deserve.

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:56.004
Good luck in all your future endeavors.
