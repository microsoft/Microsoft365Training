00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.001
- [Instructor] One of the most effective uses of mail merge

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.009
is creating labels for mass communication.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.002
It adds a nice touch of professionalism

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.001
when mailings are addressed easily and properly.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.002
In this lesson, I'm going to show you ways to use Word

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:17.002
and Excel to create a mail merge

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.004
for generating your own labels.

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.008
Please note that the mail merge feature is only available

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.002
in the desktop version.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:30.003
To get started, I'll open a blank Microsoft Word document

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:35.000
and select mailings from the top ribbon.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.003
Next, select start mail merge

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:42.006
and then the step by step mail merge wizard.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:45.000
The mail merge wizard takes you through the process

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of creating labels step by step.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.005
When the mail merge panel opens on the right side

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:54.000
of the screen, select labels then select

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.009
next, starting document.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:05.007
Select label options, then look up the label vendor

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:15.004
and product number for your physical labels and select OK.

00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:18.002
To view the label grid, go to the Layout tab

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:27.000
on the top ribbon and select view grid lines.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.008
Then move on to the next step

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:34.005
by selecting next, select recipients.

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:38.004
Follow along by downloading the list in the exercise file,

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.009
it's called example contact list.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:51.007
Select browse to find your recipient list Excel document,

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.006
then select Open.

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:58.002
In the next window, make sure the first row of data

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:05.009
contains column headers box is selected and select OK.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.009
This lets Word know that the first row

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.000
does not contain mailing information for your labels.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.003
Now you can check your list

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:21.003
and when you're sure everything is correct select OK.

00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.005
Select next arrange your labels

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:28.007
when you're ready to move on.

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:30.007
Add the appropriate address information

00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:36.002
by selecting address block and view how the addresses

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:39.004
will appear in the insert address block window.

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:40.008
You can preview each recipient

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:47.004
by going through the arrows at the top of the box.

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:50.003
If the data isn't going into the labels correctly,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.006
try editing the match fields to make sure

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:55.000
the appropriate headings line up.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.005
For example, first name needs to align

00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.001
with the first name heading and address one

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:24.001
with the billing address and so on and so forth.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:34.009
Once you've confirmed everything is correct, select OK,

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:40.001
and update all labels and then move on to the next step,

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:43.002
preview your labels.

00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:45.004
Finally, you're ready to complete the mail merge

00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:49.009
by selecting next, complete the mail merge.

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.009
Now you're ready to print your labels,

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:57.000
select print and select if you want to print all

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
or some of the labels and then select, OK.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.009
You can select OK again if all printer information

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.009
is accurate and your labels will print out.

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:13.003
Setting up labels takes a few steps, but once it's complete,

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:15.001
you've set yourself up for success

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.009
and all your labeling needs are addressed.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.006
Try creating labels or envelopes

00:04:19.006 --> 00:04:21.002
