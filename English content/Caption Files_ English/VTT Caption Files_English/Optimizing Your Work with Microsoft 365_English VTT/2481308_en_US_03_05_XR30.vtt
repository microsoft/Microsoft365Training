00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Creating and delivering presentations

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.000
is an important skill to have in the workplace.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.007
When you create a presentation,

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.008
you need to consider accessibility

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:12.007
to ensure it has an inclusive delivery format.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.007
In this lesson, I'm going to show you

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.005
how to make your presentations more accessible

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.001
and make sure no one is left out.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:24.001
Before I dive in, I want to review a few key terms.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.004
The accessibility checker allows you

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.005
to review the accessibility of your presentation.

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:34.008
It suggests how to address issues using alternative text

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.007
with all visual elements.

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.009
When you use the accessibility checker,

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.008
you'll see an accessibility panel with four areas -

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:47.004
errors, warnings, tips and intelligent services.

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.008
Errors are elements of your presentation

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.008
that make it difficult for someone to use.

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:55.009
Warnings include content that could be difficult

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.007
for people with disabilities to understand

00:00:58.007 --> 00:01:01.005
which could be related to contrast or format.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:04.003
Tips: Address accessibility issues

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:07.002
which could be better presented or described.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.002
Intelligent services uses alternative text

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.004
to describe low vision images or graphics.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:17.004
And alternative text or alt text for short

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:21.002
is descriptive text which conveys the meaning and context

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.000
of a visual item in a digital setting.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.004
Alt text allows screen reader software

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.008
to describe the images and other non-text content

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.000
that a user cannot see.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.007
Okay, now I want to show you these tools in action.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:39.004
To start, open the presentation in PowerPoint.

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.001
Follow along by downloading the sample presentation

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.008
in your exercise files.

00:01:43.008 --> 00:01:51.003
It's called Customer Event Example (B).

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.001
Go to the top ribbon and select review,

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.007
then check accessibility.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.002
The accessibility panel appears on the right of the screen

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:00.009
next to the slide.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.008
This presentation has errors and warnings.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.009
First, I'll select the error icon

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.005
to see what the error is and how it can be addressed.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:15.001
The error states missing alternative text.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:20.001
This means alt text needs to be added to the image.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.009
Select it and PowerPoint takes you to the error

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.003
on the presentation.

00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:31.001
Right-click the image and select alt text

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.008
and enter a short description.

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:36.008
It's best to convey the content and purpose of the image

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:41.003
with a short description, no more than two sentences long.

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:48.002
I'll type, handshake with people.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:52.001
I can also select the generate a description for me button

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:54.006
underneath the description box.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:59.007
I'll delete what I just typed.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:02.004
And select generate a description for me

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:09.008
and watch the alt text appear beneath the image.

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:14.009
Okay, the error is resolved so I can close the alt text box

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.006
and select recheck in the accessibility window.

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:20.001
Select the warnings button.

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:22.003
The accessibility checker tells me that

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:25.009
there is hard to read text contrast.

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:29.001
I'll select the dropdown and select this issue.

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.002
The table has contrast issues

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.007
which means the colors are too similar.

00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:36.008
To fix this, select the table,

00:03:36.008 --> 00:03:40.000
navigate to the top ribbon and select table.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.003
From here, select cell shading

00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:46.000
and pick a color that has a deeper tone

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.007
to differentiate the colors.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:51.009
I'll choose blue.

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:57.001
I'll select recheck again, and see the warning is gone.

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.006
When it comes time to deliver your presentation,

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.009
it's important to consider those with hearing difficulties.

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:06.005
Adding subtitles ensures that everyone can follow along

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:09.006
with what is being said during the presentation.

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:14.005
To add subtitles, go to the slideshow tab on the top ribbon.

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:17.007
Select always use subtitles

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:26.003
and then, the spoken and subtitle languages in the dropdown.

00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:29.004
You can also specify where the subtitles will appear

00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:37.002
and which microphone the app will use.

00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:40.007
Now when you're presenting, the microphone icon will be red

00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:43.007
to indicate that it is live and ready for you to speak.

00:04:43.007 --> 00:04:45.009
It will pick up your voice as you present

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.005
and the corresponding subtitles will appear.

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:54.001
Calendars help people organize their schedules.

00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:57.000
Make sure to speak clearly and slowly

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.001
so that your voice is picked up appropriately.

00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:01.009
If you want to turn off the subtitles

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.009
during your presentation, select the use subtitles button

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.002
indicated by a monitor icon on the toolbar

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:11.006
in the lower left corner.

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:14.001
Try using these accessibility features

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:15.007
in your next presentation

00:05:15.007 --> 00:05:18.003
to help you share your ideas inclusively.
