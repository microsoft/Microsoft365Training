00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Between new conversations, documents,

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.006
and messages, if you leave your inbox unorganized,

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:09.002
all the emails you receive can be difficult to sort through.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.007
In this lesson I'm going to show you a few best practices

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.006
for organizing your email inbox in Outlook

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:16.006
so you can keep track

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.006
of the flow of information as it comes in.

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.005
One of the best ways to keep emails top of mind

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.003
is to add flags.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:28.003
Flags are an easy way to label the importance of an email

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.006
that you aren't going to take immediate action on.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:34.007
In this example, I'll flag the emails that are related

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:37.002
to the event that I'm managing.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.002
So first I'm going to start

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:43.009
from the Microsoft 365 homepage and open Outlook.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.001
Here I'm in my inbox.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.008
There are new unread messages

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:51.002
as well as messages that I've already read.

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:52.003
To set a flag,

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.009
hover your cursor over the email message,

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.009
then select the flag icon in the top right corner

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:59.008
of the message.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.003
The flag changes to red.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.007
And when the email message is opened,

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:07.006
a followup message appears in the header of the email.

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:11.007
To remove the flag, select the flag icon.

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:14.005
The follow up flag changes to a check mark.

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:16.000
When the email is open,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in the top header it states the date the flag was complete.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.002
Another way to keep emails organized

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.005
is to use color categories.

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:27.002
Color categories allow you to identify

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.007
and group associated items in Outlook

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.006
so you can quickly track and organize them.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:36.003
Before using a color category you first need to create one.

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.007
Select the email you wish to add to a category,

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.005
navigate to the ribbon,

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:46.005
identify the categorize icon, select the dropdown menu,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:49.008
and then new category.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.009
Add a name for the category and select a color,

00:01:52.009 --> 00:02:00.008
I'll name mine customer event.

00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:03.000
Then select save.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.004
This color category is now ready to use.

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:10.007
Next I'll right click a message from the message list,

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:15.005
select categorize, and select the category I just created

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.007
from the list.

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.007
You can even assign a color category from the reading pane

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:24.000
or an open message.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.003
The next inbox organizing tool I recommend using

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.000
is auto reply.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.007
Auto reply allows you to respond to emails

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.009
when you're out of office or unavailable.

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:40.006
To set up auto reply select the settings icon,

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:45.005
then view all Outlook settings.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:51.005
And then automatic replies.

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.008
Turn on the automatic replies toggle

00:02:53.008 --> 00:03:00.001
and then you can type your message in the message box.

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.001
Type in your out of office message.

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.001
I like to use something like, thank you for your email.

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:06.006
I am out of the office.

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:09.008
I will respond when I return.

00:03:09.008 --> 00:03:12.000
If you don't want your out of office message

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.001
sent all the time, select send replies during a time period.

00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:19.002
Then choose the dates and times

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:32.005
you'd like to set your automatic reply for.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:33.005
You can also select

00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:35.004
if you want Outlook to block your calendar

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:38.003
for that time period, decline new invites,

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:41.009
or cancel any meetings you might have during this period.

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.003
You can format the text using the toolbar

00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:47.001
or cut and paste text you've already formatted,

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:50.000
including hyperlinked text.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.009
When you're finished

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:55.008
with the message and settings, select save.

00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:59.001
Now Outlook is programmed to send the automated reply

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.005
as a response to messages during your selected times.

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:05.003
Sorting and organizing your email are key skills

00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:08.005
for keeping important communications and information

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:10.003
easy to find.

00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:12.009
An organized inbox will keep you focused

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:17.000
and allow you to spend your time on more important tasks.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.009
Try using these tools to bring order

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:22.002
to your inbox this week and see how much time you can save.
