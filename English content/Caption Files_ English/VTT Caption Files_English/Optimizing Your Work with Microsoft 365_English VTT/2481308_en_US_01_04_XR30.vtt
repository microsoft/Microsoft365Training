00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] With busy schedules,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.005
sometimes it's hard to find free time to meet

00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.000
with a group of people.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.002
What if there was an easy way to find open meeting times

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:12.002
and invite attendees all in one step?

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.001
Outlook is a powerful tool you can use

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.006
to schedule meetings.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.002
After this lesson, you'll be able to use Outlook

00:00:18.002 --> 00:00:21.006
to schedule meetings and manage your attendees easily.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:28.004
I'll start from the Microsoft 365 homepage and open Outlook.

00:00:28.004 --> 00:00:35.000
From here I'll open the calendar I'll be scheduling from.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.008
In this example, I'll look for a common time to meet

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.007
with the speakers of an event that I'm organizing.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:43.005
Before I jump into actually scheduling meetings,

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.002
I need to see where there are openings in their schedules.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.005
The scheduling assistant is a tool that checks the calendars

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:52.005
of all potential event attendees for common openings

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.000
at the same time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.005
In the menu bar select the new event button.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.001
This opens the schedule a meeting page.

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.009
I'll select scheduling assistant

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.002
from the menu bar at the top.

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:05.004
I can add the date and time

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.005
that I would like to schedule my meeting.

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:08.007
I'm going to schedule my meeting

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:19.001
for March 11th from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.004
To add people to the meeting,

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:24.009
select add required attendee or optional attendee.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.006
You can also add a meeting room from the same window.

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:37.009
I'm going to add my attendees.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.003
This outlined bar represents the meeting time.

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.009
You can check the legend at the bottom

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.001
of the scheduling window to see what the colors

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.007
in the bars mean.

00:01:46.007 --> 00:01:49.000
By default, you can only see free

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.003
or busy information in the bars.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.004
You cannot see any other details

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:56.005
unless an attendee shares their calendar with you.

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:59.001
Just knowing if an attendee is free or busy

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.005
gives you enough information to try and find

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:02.004
a meeting time

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.003
that doesn't conflict with everyone's schedule.

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.002
If scheduling conflicts appear,

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.003
you can move the meeting time by changing

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.003
the start and end time up by the dates and times

00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:14.007
near the top of the scheduling window.

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.009
After you find a time that works for everyone,

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.009
you can send an update.

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:20.009
Select done in the top left corner

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:27.000
of the scheduling assistant window.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.004
Add a title to your meeting and select send.

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.004
And now each attendee gets a meeting request

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.006
and the event appears on their calendars.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.001
It can be quite a juggling act to find a meeting time

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:44.006
that works for everyone,

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:48.002
but the scheduling assistant makes the search much simpler.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.007
Now you try, use the scheduling assistant

00:02:50.007 --> 00:02:52.002
to schedule your next meeting.
