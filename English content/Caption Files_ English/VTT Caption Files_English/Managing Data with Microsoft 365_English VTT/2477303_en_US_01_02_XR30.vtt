00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.004
- [Instructor] Just like ship captains use the stars,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.004
having the skills to navigate through software

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.007
is key to getting where you want to go.

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:07.005
In this lesson,

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.001
I'm going to walk you through the tools

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.005
that will keep you organized

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:14.000
as you create surveys and quizzes in Microsoft Forms.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Starting from the Microsoft 365 homepage,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.006
I'll go to the app launcher and open Forms.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.001
Here, I can create a new form,

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:27.000
view my recent forms, pinned forms,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.008
and forms shared with me.

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.005
If I scroll to the bottom,

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.004
there is the My Group's pane

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.002
where you can see the groups you're a member of

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.007
and the total number of forms in each group.

00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:39.009
What's important here at the bottom of my forms,

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:42.007
is the All My Forms button.

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:44.006
This will bring me to a list

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.004
with a list of all the forms I've created here.

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:48.007
You'll see the forms I've created

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.005
and the number of responses.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.008
On the My forms page,

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.004
you have the ability to group your forms

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.007
into collections to keep them organized together.

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:59.007
New Collection is located on the upper right.

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:02.004
I created one collection that has my surveys.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:06.003
Forms also gives you the choice of viewing a list or a grid.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.006
This option is in the top right corner of your screen.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.005
I like grid view

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.008
because I usually set a theme for each form,

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.002
making them easy to recognize and find.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:16.009
With List View,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.001
I can see all the forms I've created.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.007
I can delete a form by clicking the More Options

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:27.006
in the lower right corner of a card and selecting delete.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:32.000
I'll confirm by clicking delete.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.004
If you need to restore a form that you've already deleted,

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:37.007
not to worry, you can get it back from the recycle bin

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:39.008
in the lower right corner.

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.008
Now you're ready to use Microsoft Forms

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.004
to choose the right tools to quickly navigate to your forms.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:48.007
Try it out by logging into Microsoft 365,

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.003
go into the Forms app, and making your first form.
