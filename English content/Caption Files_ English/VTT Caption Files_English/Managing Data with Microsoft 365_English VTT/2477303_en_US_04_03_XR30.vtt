00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- [Instructor] Reports need data.

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.006
Before you can create visualizations and gain insights,

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:09.008
you'll need to be able to import datasets into Power BI.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:12.001
In this lesson, I'll walk you through two ways

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.000
that you can import data into this powerful software.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.005
You can install Power BI on your PC

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:22.006
by going to the Microsoft Store and searching for Power BI.

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:26.003
When you open Power BI Desktop, you'll see the start screen.

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:28.005
I'll go ahead and close it.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.009
The first way to import data for your reports

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.006
is from an Excel spreadsheet.

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:34.005
In this example,

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.007
I am importing a list of customers from Excel.

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:39.003
There are two ways to do this.

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.009
You can either select Excel workbook in the ribbon

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:45.004
near the top of the screen, or import data from Excel

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.008
from the Add Data menu.

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:51.003
I'm going to select Excel workbook from the home ribbon.

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.002
This brings up a dialogue where I can select

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:55.006
the spreadsheet I want to import.

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.005
I'm going to open the customer file.

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.000
You can download this in the exercise files.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.003
It's called Customer Data.

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:06.002
Navigator opens and has identified one data table

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:09.003
in my worksheet called Customer.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.002
The data looks correct, so I will select Load

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:14.007
and bring it into Power BI.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:18.008
The Customer table now displays in the Fields pane.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:22.000
When I expand the Customer table using the dropdown,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.009
I can see the fields it contains.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.005
For a detailed look at your dataset,

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:30.000
you can select the Data tab on the left panel.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The next way to import data for your reports

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.009
is from the web.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.001
Let's say I want to compare my sales to state populations.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:42.000
I can import the data from online into Power BI.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.004
I'll start by selecting the dropdown under Get Data

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:46.009
on the home ribbon at the top of the workspace

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.003
and then select Web.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:53.005
Then I'll paste the URL for my data and select, OK.

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.005
The Navigator dialogue shows all the tables Power BI

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.008
found on that webpage.

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:02.004
I can preview each one to find the table I'm looking for.

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.004
I'll select Table 1, but based on the preview,

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.002
I'll need to filter out some of the fields

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.003
and clean up the rows.

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.009
Select Transform Data to open the Power Query editor.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.000
This is where you can modify the data used

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.003
in your visualizations.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.007
To do this, I'll remove the columns I'm not interested in.

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.003
I don't need the ranking columns,

00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:23.009
so I'll select the first column.

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:28.006
And in the top ribbon, I'll select remove columns twice.

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:31.007
Notice how as changes are made, you'll be able to see them

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:34.000
in the Query Settings panel on the right,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in the Applied Steps box.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
If I need to undo a step, say removing a column,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.004
I can select the X next to that step.

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:45.001
So now I have a clean table,

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:47.008
and it's ready for my workspace.

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:50.005
Before closing the table, I'm going to give it a name

00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:54.003
by right-clicking the table name and selecting Rename.

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.005
I'll enter States.

00:02:56.005 --> 00:03:00.000
Then I'll select Close and Apply.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.004
Now, the States table is in the Fields panel

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:06.000
on the right side of the screen and is ready for use.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.009
Creating visual images starts with having the right data.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.007
Consider what data you have access to,

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:15.000
and try importing it into Power BI.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.004
Whether it's an Excel workbook or the web,

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:19.008
Power BI can support you in collecting your data

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:22.005
to create compelling visualizations.

00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:24.007
