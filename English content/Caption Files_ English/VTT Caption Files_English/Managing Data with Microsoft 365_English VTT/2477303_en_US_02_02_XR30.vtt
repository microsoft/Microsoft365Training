00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.009
- [Instructor] If you're going to build a house,

00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:03.000
you need to know the difference

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.003
between a hammer and a screwdriver.

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.005
Getting to know your tools ahead of time

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:11.001
saves you headaches in the long run on any project.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.008
In this lesson, I'll show you how to launch Power Automate

00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:19.000
so that you can confidently navigate it to create flows.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.002
Let's talk about structure.

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:24.008
Power Automate processes are known as flows.

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:29.003
These can be described as when this happens, do something.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:33.001
A connector is a connection to a service or product

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.002
like Outlook or forms.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:39.000
Connectors contain triggers and actions.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.006
A trigger is the when this happens part.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.005
An action is the do something part.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.005
Together, they build a flow.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.003
Now that you understand the relationship

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.006
between a connector and trigger,

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.005
I want to show you how to create a flow.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.008
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:03.005
I'll select the app launcher and open Power Automate.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.000
Here on the Power Automate homepage,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.004
you can see a list of different templates and tutorials

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.004
for getting started.

00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:15.001
Power Automate provides three options for creating a flow.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:19.002
I can see these by selecting create on the left side.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:22.008
First, you can start from blank.

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.007
You might use this when you already know

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.006
what connectors and actions you need.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.007
You also have the option to create a flow

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.002
by starting from a template.

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:35.000
These are commonly used in popular templates,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.005
which could help you solve a task you have already.

00:01:38.005 --> 00:01:41.001
Or, you can start from a connector.

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.004
You can use this when you know

00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:45.001
what service you want to create an automation around

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:49.000
but are unsure what actions may be available to use.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.001
The flows you've created are kept in the My Flows tab.

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:56.000
As you get more comfortable with Power Automate's layout,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
you'll be able to quickly activate flows

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and improve your productivity.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.003
So dive in and start exploring flow templates

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:06.002
that will eliminate repetitive tasks out of your workday.
