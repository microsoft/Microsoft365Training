00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Imagine you're staring at a table

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.007
in Excel and attempting to make sense

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:07.000
of the relationships between several sheets.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.009
Working with data

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.008
means dealing with the variety of formats

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.005
it appears in.

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:13.007
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.007
how to use Power BI's intelligent import tool

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:18.009
to assist you in creating relationships

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.007
between several sources of data.

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:23.001
You'll be able to join data

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.008
to make it easier to work with.

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:28.003
You can install Power BI on your PC

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:29.009
by going to the Microsoft Store,

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.004
and searching for Power BI.

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.004
When you open Power BI Desktop,

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.004
you'll see the start screen.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.007
I'll go ahead and close it.

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.000
I'll open the report I've been working on.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.001
You can download this in the exercise files.

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.004
It's called customer sample report.

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.008
This report has a list of names and addresses

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:51.008
of my customers.

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:53.007
I also have a separate Excel spreadsheet

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.003
with their orders.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.000
I want to combine these to create

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.008
a visual aid for the delivery team.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.002
First, select Excel Workbook

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:05.004
from the home tab on the top ribbon.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.008
Then browse for the sales order workbook,

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:09.009
which has two sheets.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.005
You can download this in the exercise files,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.007
it's called sales order.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:18.009
Select both sheets then select load.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.007
After both spreadsheets load,

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.008
you can see the tables in the field's panel

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.006
on the right.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.007
Select model on the left menu,

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.002
and you'll see the relationship

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:30.008
Power BI found between the different tables

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.006
when it loaded both sheets.

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.001
A data model is the relationship

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.008
between the different data sources.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:38.007
On the top ribbon,

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.006
select managed relationships.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.004
Here I can see that sales order ID

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.009
is the common field

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.002
between the sales order detail table,

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:51.003
and the sales order header table.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:54.005
Additionally, customer ID is the common field

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:56.004
between the sales order header table,

00:01:56.004 --> 00:01:58.007
and the customer table.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:02.004
Now all three of the tables are connected.

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:04.006
Let's explore the customer ID relationship

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.003
by selecting the second row,

00:02:06.003 --> 00:02:09.002
and then edit at the bottom.

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:12.001
The cardinality field tells Power BI

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.001
which table has the primary record

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.007
for the customer ID column.

00:02:16.007 --> 00:02:17.008
In our example,

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:20.003
the customer table is the primary record.

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:24.000
So each customer ID will appear once.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.002
A customer will likely place many orders,

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:27.009
and therefore Power BI

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:31.001
sets the cardinality to many to one.

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.001
You can modify this if necessary.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:35.005
I'll select, okay.

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.004
Then close.

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.003
Pulling data from multiple spreadsheets

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.004
is a breeze in Power BI.

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:43.003
You can easily create relationships

00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.006
between tables by finding the common fields

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:47.004
in those tables,

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:49.000
which means you can create reports

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.006
across multiple tables.

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.004
Take some time to build relationships

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:56.000
in Power BI with your existing spreadsheets.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.001
You've got this.
