00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Adding visuals to your reports

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:03.006
will make your presentations

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.006
more engaging and more memorable.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.000
In this lesson, I'll walk you through a few ways

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.002
that Power BI lets you build reports.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:13.001
In this example,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.006
I'll build multiple charts using sample data

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.006
of a company sales for 2021.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.008
You can install Power BI on your PC

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:25.005
by going to the Microsoft store and searching for Power BI.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.009
I have already imported the data

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.004
from sales order and customer files,

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.007
which you can find in the exercise files.

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.001
On the visualization panel,

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.000
there are several options to make a chart.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.002
I want to build one showing how many items

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:41.006
were sold each month.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.002
I'm going select the stacked column chart

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:47.001
because it will let me place time on the bottom axis

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.008
and count the orders on the vertical axis.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:54.003
A blank visual is added to my workspace,

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.009
I'll select order date from the sales order

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.009
header table in the field's list.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:04.008
Order date gets added in the axis box and visualizations.

00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:07.006
Power BI determined that the field was a date

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.005
and produces a date hierarchy

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.003
of year, quarter, month, and day.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:14.009
I'll select the X next to year

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.008
and quarter to remove them from my visualization

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.009
since I only need month and day.

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.001
Next, drag order quantity

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.007
from sales order details into values.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.005
The data values showed on the chart

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.006
will be the sum of items sold that month.

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.009
The visual is populated, but very small.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.003
I'll select the bottom right corner

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.005
of the visual and drag it to fill the screen.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:43.006
Now I can see that the most items were sold in February.

00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:45.006
I might prefer to see this with the date

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:50.005
on the vertical axis, so I can select stacked bar chart.

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.008
The last change I want to make to this chart is

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.008
to give it an easily understood name,

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:59.003
right now it's order quantity by month.

00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:02.004
In the visualizations panel I'll select format,

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:07.002
expand title and change the title text to be monthly orders.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:08.009
These visualizations will help you

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.008
to analyze the data at a glance.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.007
Now that I've built my first Power BI visualization,

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:18.004
I want to create one more before finishing this report.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:20.003
I'll shrink the monthly orders visual,

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:22.007
giving me room to work.

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.004
Next, let's create a donut chart to gain insight

00:02:25.004 --> 00:02:28.000
into the companies that purchase the most.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.004
The donut chart format will quickly show me

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:32.005
the top purchasers.

00:02:32.005 --> 00:02:36.002
In the home ribbon, select new visual.

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:40.002
In the visualization pane, I'll select donut chart.

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:43.009
First, I'll pull in the total sales using line total,

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.002
select the check box next to line total

00:02:46.002 --> 00:02:48.008
in sales order details.

00:02:48.008 --> 00:02:51.009
Looking at this, we see that the line total is being shown

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:56.001
as a decimal number instead of a monetary sum.

00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.001
I'll select line total, and we'll change the formatting

00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.002
of this by selecting display the values in this column

00:03:02.002 --> 00:03:05.005
as currency, we see that the total

00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:10.002
for this chart is now $708,000 of sales.

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.003
Now, select the checkbox for company name

00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:16.001
in the customer table and the donut chart

00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:20.003
will populate with the customer names by total sales.

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.004
Move and resize the two visuals

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.005
so they show up well on the page.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.003
Finally, since this report will be for our California

00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:32.005
sales team, I'm going to apply a filter to the page.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:36.000
Expand the filters panel and drag state province

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.001
from customer into the filters on this page box.

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.000
This will allow me to apply a filter

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.007
of customer state equals California

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.008
to all my visuals on the page.

00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:51.009
I'll select California and see the visuals change,

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.007
February continues to be the month

00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:57.006
when most items are ordered by California customers.

00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.005
Eastside Department Store is the biggest purchaser

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:02.006
in California.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.004
I now have a report ready to share

00:04:04.004 --> 00:04:06.007
with our California team.

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:09.001
Bar charts and donut charts are just the beginning

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:12.003
of what you can accomplish with this software.

00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:14.001
Power BI has many more options

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:16.005
to help you present your data.

00:04:16.005 --> 00:04:19.001
Figure out what data points you can visually represent

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.002
to help your team grow and collaborate.

00:04:22.002 --> 00:04:24.009
By finding opportunities to make visualizations,

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.009
you can clearly communicate your impact

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.001
and effectiveness to your team, clients, and stakeholders.
