- [Christine] Learning how to manage data in Microsoft 365

00:00:03.006 --> 00:00:06.000
is a key skill that will enable you to take

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.009
on any project with certainty.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.007
Managing data might sound like a task

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:15.008
for computer scientists, programmers and librarians,

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:19.008
but nearly everyone in the workplace manages data daily.

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.007
Microsoft 365 has extraordinary tools

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.004
to help you manage your data like a pro.

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.001
My name is Christine Matheney

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.007
and I'm a program manager at Microsoft.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:34.003
In this course, I'm going to show you how to gather,

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.007
organize and distribute data using data tools,

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:43.007
including Forms, Power Automate, Excel and Power BI.

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:45.006
You'll learn high level skills

00:00:45.006 --> 00:00:49.005
including how to customize forms, create pivot tables

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:54.000
and even create reports in Power BI.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.001
Learning how to manage data in Microsoft 365

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.005
is a key skill that will enable you

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.004
to take on any project with certainty.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:03.004
Let's get started.
