00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Instructor] Filters provide lots of benefits,

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.002
especially when working with data.

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.006
In this lesson,

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll show you how to build PivotTables, select fields,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.008
and use filters in your own data in Excel

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:15.007
to inform your business decisions.

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.005
In the top left corner of Office.com,

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:22.001
I'll select the app launcher and open Excel.

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.008
From here, I'll open the Test Sales Order spreadsheet.

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:26.009
You can follow along

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.003
with this document in your exercise files.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.007
This spreadsheet has a dataset,

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.005
Sales Orders and their details.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's say that I need the data

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.003
by product and then by customer,

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.007
so that I can gain insight

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:41.006
into which products are doing well,

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:44.009
and which customers are purchasing them.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.008
To do that, I'll create a PivotTable,

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.004
which will allow me to see the link

00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:51.003
between the products and customers.

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:53.004
First, I'll select cell A1,

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.001
the first cell in my data set.

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.000
Then I'll select the Insert tab in the top ribbon,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.003
and select PivotTable.

00:01:01.003 --> 00:01:03.001
The PivotTable drop down appears,

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.004
and I will select From Table/Range

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:08.001
to get the data from this sheet.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:11.008
The Insert PivotTable pane opens on the right.

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.002
In Source, I can see that Excel picked

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.006
the order detail sheet

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.002
and selected all the values in my table.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:20.008
In the PivotTable pane,

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:22.007
I'll use Create your own PivotTable

00:01:22.007 --> 00:01:25.004
and insert it on a new sheet.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:29.004
This way, I am able to customize the PivotTable to my needs

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:32.006
and it will be separated from my current data.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:33.008
This opens a new sheet

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.004
with the PivotTable on the left

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.000
and the PivotTable fields panel on the right.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In that panel, I can see there are two columns,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.002
one for the headers from my data table,

00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:50.001
and then one with Filter, Rows, Columns, and Values.

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.002
I'll choose the data points I need.

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.007
Products sorted by largest customer orders.

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:57.001
First I'll select Product

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.000
which populates column A with all the products sold.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.006
Next, since I want to see

00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:05.001
each customer that purchased those products,

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.006
I'll add Customer to the Filter section

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:11.001
and Line Total to the Sum Values section.

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:15.002
This aggregates all the line totals for each customer.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.000
Let's filter this by Channel Outlet

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.003
to see what they purchased.

00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:20.004
I'll select the dropdown

00:02:20.004 --> 00:02:23.002
next to Customer in cell B2,

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:27.008
deselect Select All and select Channel Outlet.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.004
I can also add Order Quantity to Rows

00:02:30.004 --> 00:02:31.007
so that I can clearly see

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:35.002
the number of units this customer purchased.

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:36.007
Now it's your turn.

00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:38.009
Take a look at your organization's spreadsheets

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:42.000
and create useful PivotTables in Excel.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You'll have your data in an easy to review format.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Try them this week.
