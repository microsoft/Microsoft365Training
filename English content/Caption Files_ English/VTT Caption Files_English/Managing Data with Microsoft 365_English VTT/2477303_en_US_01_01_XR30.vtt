00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.005
- [Narrator] You may not realize it,

00:00:01.005 --> 00:00:04.007
but forms are used all the time in your daily life.

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.006
Everything from casting your vote

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.001
to filling out a feedback survey

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.001
from your favorite coffee brand,

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.000
forms are used to gather all kinds of data.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.001
In this lesson,

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.003
I'll show you how to use Microsoft Forms to make surveys,

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.009
quizzes, and sign up forms

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.006
to reveal any data you're looking for.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:24.000
In the top left corner of office.com.,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'll select the app launcher and open forms to get started.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.008
Surveys gather data from clients

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.009
and can inform you of opportunities to improve.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.006
For example, I use a survey every semester

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:38.006
to gauge my effectiveness as a lecturer.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:41.001
Another great way businesses can use forms is

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.000
to collect information.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.003
This is a t-shirt signup form.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.007
Not only do you get information on a client's t-shirt size,

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:51.008
but you also get their contact information.

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:55.002
You can also use forms for event registration.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.000
Having a single list of all the people

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.003
who are attending an event electronically is the best way

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.002
to stay organized.

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:03.002
By creating a survey

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:05.007
for all your company's event registrations,

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.007
you'll always be able to track down necessary information

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.007
like number of RSVPs and anything else you need

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.007
to create a seamless event.

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.000
While forms and surveys allow you to gather data,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.003
you can also use quizzes to assess the knowledge

00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:20.007
of your clients and coworkers.

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:22.004
Quizzes can be fun.

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:25.001
I've used this animal quiz icebreaker to engage

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.006
with my team at the start of a meeting.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.005
You can easily assess quiz results

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.008
with the Microsoft Forms response tab.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.006
Let's take a look at this animal quiz.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:36.002
I can easily scroll through the results

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.006
to see which questions were the most difficult

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:40.001
and which were the easiest.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:42.000
This is indicated on my screen by looking

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.008
for the questions that have the least number correct

00:01:44.008 --> 00:01:47.004
or those that have the most number correct.

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:50.002
I can also see the results graphically for a quick glimpse

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:52.007
into how everyone is doing with the material.

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:55.005
You can also download the data in Excel or import the data

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.003
into your favorite reporting tool to do further analysis.

00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.007
Microsoft Forms provide several opportunities

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:04.009
for you to gather information and assess data.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.006
This week create a fun quiz

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.003
for your coworkers, clients, or students.

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:10.005
Getting data directly

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.003
from your audience can only serve to improve your work.
