00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Once I've created a survey,

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:03.004
I can't wait to send it to my clients

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.000
and collaborators, so they can fill it out.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.004
In this lesson, I'll show you the ways you can share

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.001
a survey created in Microsoft Forms.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.004
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:17.005
I'll select the app launcher in open forms.

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:20.001
From here, I'll open the wedding planning

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.005
consulting interest form.

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.006
To share the survey, and gather data from your clients,

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.009
you'll select share in the upper right corner of the screen.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.005
Let's look at send and collect responses.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.000
There are four options for sharing a form,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.005
a link, QR code, embed, or email.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.002
This dialogue defaults to the link option.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.002
So, I'll show you that option first.

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:47.003
You can use a link in an email, a chat,

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:48.008
or even on social media.

00:00:48.008 --> 00:00:49.008
Before sending a link,

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:52.003
I recommend checking the shortened URL box.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:55.000
This will generate a short web address.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.004
Let's test the link before sending it to clients.

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:02.005
First, copy the shortened URL by selecting copy.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.006
Then open a blank tab in your browser, then right click

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:09.004
in the address bar and select paste.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.002
You're getting a look at how your client will view

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.004
this link in their web browser.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.002
Let's keep exploring.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:18.001
The next option is to generate a QR code.

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.005
When you select this option, Forms provide you

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:22.005
with a QR code image.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.002
You'll download the QR code image,

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.007
and then, you can add it to any document.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.005
The third option is to get a code to embed your survey

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:31.000
into your websites.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.006
You can use the HTML code Forms provides

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:35.004
in a website or email.

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.000
To get the code select copy.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.009
The final way you can share a survey is with an email.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.001
When you select this option

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.001
your devices default email program

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:49.004
will open a new email draft with the form link in the body.

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:51.002
So, once your survey is out in the world,

00:01:51.002 --> 00:01:53.009
I'm sure you'll be eager to see the results.

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.005
To see the results of my survey,

00:01:55.005 --> 00:02:00.001
I'll select the responses tab to view the data.

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:02.004
In the responses view, I can open an Excel

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:04.008
to view the data in Excel.

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:06.008
An Excel file will be downloaded that contains

00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:08.003
the current results of your survey,

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.007
which is helpful for analyzing, sharing, and reporting.

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:13.004
Being able to share your hard work

00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:15.007
and get the information you're looking for is easy

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:17.004
when using Microsoft Forms.

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.007
You now have a variety of options to send your survey

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.004
to current and potential clients.

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.002
Give it a try.
