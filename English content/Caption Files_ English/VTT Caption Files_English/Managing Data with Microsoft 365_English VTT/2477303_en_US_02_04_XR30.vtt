00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- [Narrator] To complete your goals, making a list of tasks

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.000
for the day can keep you on track.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.009
To free up even more time to spend on what really matters,

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:12.004
you can go beyond a list of tasks with automation.

00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:16.002
In this lesson, I'll show you how to use Power Automate

00:00:16.002 --> 00:00:20.006
to create and assign tasks to team members using templates.

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.004
Let's jump in.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.009
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.001
I'll select the app launcher and open Power Automate.

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
From here, I'll select templates from the left panel.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.004
The templates are sorted by popularity,

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.003
and at the top of the list, there's different categories

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.002
sorted by connectors and triggers.

00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:43.001
The flow I want to create will be triggered

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.001
when a client fills out the wedding planning

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.002
consulting interest form.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.008
Let's search for planner and forms by entering

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:53.001
forms and planner into the search box.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.006
Some template leveraging these products load,

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.003
and I'll select Create a task in Planner

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.007
from Microsoft Forms and post message in Teams.

00:01:02.007 --> 00:01:05.003
This way, I'll be able to track the incoming requests

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:08.001
in Planner and notify my team when new clients

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.000
request support.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.004
This page shows an overview

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.005
of the template and its connections,

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:17.004
Microsoft Forms, Planner, and Teams.

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.006
Select Continue.

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:22.005
Before starting to add content I like to do a quick scan

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:25.008
of the template and make sure it will serve my needs.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.007
This flow will be triggered when a new form

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:29.008
response is submitted.

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.008
It will use the details of the response to create a task,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.007
and then will post a message in Teams.

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.009
Perfect.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.006
I'll select the ABC Wedding Planning

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:42.005
Consulting Interest form as a trigger by selecting

00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:45.001
Pick a form in the Form ID box

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:48.003
of When a new response is submitted.

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:52.002
Then repeat with the same form and get response details.

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:55.007
Response ID is pre-populated by the template.

00:01:55.007 --> 00:01:58.007
In the Create a task section for the Plan ID

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:02.006
I'll use an existing plan called Wedding Planning Interest.

00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:05.002
I'll enter a title, Contact new client,

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:07.004
and use the Add dynamic content link

00:02:07.004 --> 00:02:18.009
to add name and email address.

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.000
I'll leave the Bucket ID and dates field blank

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.008
for this flow.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.009
Since this task is for Isaiah,

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll enter his email in the Assigned User IDs field.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.006
Finally, in the Post a message in a chat or channel section

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.005
I'll set up a notification to appear

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.000
in our Team's interest forms channel.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.005
This way, everyone will know when a form is submitted.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.009
I'll leave the first two boxes Post as Flow Bot

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.008
and Post in Channel as their defaults.

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:53.001
Flow has an automated bot that will post a message

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.001
in my Team's channel, which is perfect.

00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.000
Next I'll set my Team to Wedding Consulting,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.009
and set the channel the bot will post in to Interest Form.

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.006
Finally, I will set the message as new interest form

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:09.004
has arrived from, and add the dynamic content,

00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:18.009
first name, last name, and email address.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.007
Now the whole Team will know it has come in.

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:27.000
I'll select Save in the upper right corner.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I always check for errors by selecting the Flow checker.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.008
And once I see there are no errors,

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.008
I can test the workflow by selecting Test,

00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:37.006
then Manually then Test.

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:44.001
Lynn has this form open and will submit a test response.

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:48.000
When the form is submitted, the flow will run automatically.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.009
I now see that the flow was successful.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:54.001
The flow automatically assigned Lynn's interest to Isaiah,

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:58.000
and posted a message in the Team's Wedding Interest channel.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.006
Templates are a great way to kickstart your flow creations.

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:06.004
Chances are the flow you need probably already exists.

00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:08.007
So, take some time this week to become familiar

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:11.001
with the template options in Power Automate.

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:13.006
The beauty of templates is that you can customize the flow

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:14.007
however you need.
