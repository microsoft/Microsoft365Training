00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.003
- [Instructor] Data has become the foundation

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:06.004
in which everyone worldwide makes decisions.

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.005
But as helpful as data can be,

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.000
at times it can be overwhelming.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.004
Microsoft Power BI is a powerful data visualization tool

00:00:15.004 --> 00:00:18.003
that can create reports and dashboards,

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.007
allowing you to tell a story with your data.

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:25.008
In this lesson, I'll share the benefits of using Power BI

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.006
so that you can further your data visualization skillset.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.004
Microsoft Power BI provides a visual framework

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:33.009
for sharing data.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.004
Power BI can help model the information,

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:40.002
leading to beautiful, intuitive, interactive reports,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:42.005
helping your audience gain insights.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.008
Power BI Desktop is free to download to your PC

00:00:45.008 --> 00:00:48.002
from the Microsoft store.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:50.006
Power BI connects directly to your existing

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.000
Microsoft 365 documents, stored in your OneDrive

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or SharePoint.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.009
Being able to visualize your data

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.002
will give you an advantage as you communicate

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.004
with your team and clients.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.007
