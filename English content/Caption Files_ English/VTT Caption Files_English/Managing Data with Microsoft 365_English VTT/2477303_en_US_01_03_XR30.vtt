00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.006
- [Instructor] Creating custom forms

00:00:01.006 --> 00:00:04.007
like surveys and quizzes is an efficient and organized way

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.008
to get the information you need from internal team members

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.007
and external collaborators.

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.004
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.009
how to collect information from your audience

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.007
by building a Microsoft Form using different question types.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:20.006
In this example, I'm going to create a contact form

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.006
to drive new clients and vendors

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:24.005
to a wedding planning company.

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:26.008
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:31.004
I'll select the app launcher and open forms.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.002
I'll select new form.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:37.001
I'll start by adding a name and description.

00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:38.008
I'll set the form title to

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:42.002
Wedding Planning Consulting Interest.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.001
I want my client to feel welcome,

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.002
so I'll write a friendly description.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.004
Thank you for your interest in Wedding Planning Consulting.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.000
Please fill out the contact form

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.002
so we can make your wedding a memorable day.

00:00:55.002 --> 00:00:57.001
It's important to preview your form

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.005
to make sure it appears as intended.

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.004
The preview button on the top right

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.000
allows me to see what the form looks like.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.009
Here you'll see that the form title and description

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.004
match what I typed in.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:10.008
Below the description,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.005
you'll notice this disclosure statement.

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.006
Hi, Demo.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.001
When you submit this form,

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.004
the owner will see your name and email address.

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:23.001
By default, a form is created to collect information

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.001
from people in your organization.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.005
To change the setting,

00:01:26.005 --> 00:01:30.000
select the back button in the top left corner of the page

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.004
to go back to the form design window.

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.003
Select more form settings in the upper right corner

00:01:35.003 --> 00:01:37.008
and select settings.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.005
I'll switch who can fill out this form

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:45.003
to anyone can respond so that clients can access the form.

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:49.000
Now I'll go back to preview and the message is removed.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.006
Now that the form looks good,

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:54.005
I'll select back to continue creating my contact form.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.008
Next, I'm going to add questions to the contact form

00:01:57.008 --> 00:01:59.005
that will capture relevant information

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:00.009
about the future client

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.008
and the type of services they may be looking for.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:05.001
A good place to start

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:07.006
is to ask for their contact information.

00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:11.005
To add a new question, I'll select add new.

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:15.001
Here, I'm presented with four different question types.

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:19.003
Choice, text, rating, and date.

00:02:19.003 --> 00:02:22.000
Choice is answering a multiple choice question.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.004
Text is a fill in the blank question.

00:02:24.004 --> 00:02:26.009
Rating is giving an opinion on a scale.

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.000
And date is when you specify a date from a calendar.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.005
For contact information,

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.002
I'm going to create three text questions.

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:37.005
I'll select text and enter email address.

00:02:37.005 --> 00:02:50.008
I'll do this again for first name and last name.

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:53.002
The next piece of information that would be helpful

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:55.004
is when the clients want to get married.

00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:56.009
This type of data can be captured

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.009
with the choice question type.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:03.009
I'll select add new, choice, and enter the text

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.003
when do you plan to get married?

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:11.001
In the options field, I'll enter these options.

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:14.007
Less than six months, six to 12 months,

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:20.003
more than one year, and I don't know.

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.007
As a wedding planner, I would also like to know

00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:26.002
if the clients have already picked a wedding date.

00:03:26.002 --> 00:03:30.000
You can have them enter it using the date question type.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.006
I'll select add new, date, and enter

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:37.004
if you've already picked a date, enter it here

00:03:37.004 --> 00:03:39.003
as the question.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:42.007
And lastly, let's find out how comfortable the clients are

00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:45.000
at planning things on a scale.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.009
So, I'll select add new, rating, with the text

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:51.005
how comfortable are you planning events?

00:03:51.005 --> 00:03:54.009
Five being the most comfortable.

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:59.005
I will then select the symbol dropdown and choose number.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:03.000
In a matter of minutes, my interest form is taking shape.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.006
Microsoft Forms gives you the power

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:06.003
to intentionally gather information

00:04:06.003 --> 00:04:09.000
from clients and coworkers alike.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.001
Take some time and explore the other options

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:14.002
in the input fields and consider how you can use them

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:15.008
to get the details you need.

00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:16.007
You've got this!
