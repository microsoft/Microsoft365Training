00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.009
- [Instructor] Missing a chat or message from a customer

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.004
can mean missing out on important communication.

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.007
With Power Automate, you can respond immediately,

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:11.008
even when you're away.

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.001
In this lesson,

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.009
I'll walk you through creating an automatic email reply

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.004
to a Microsoft form response, using Power Automate,

00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:21.005
so that you can streamline your communication

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.002
and avoid missed messages.

00:00:24.002 --> 00:00:26.007
In this example, I've created a contact form

00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:29.008
for prospective clients that are interested in learning more

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:33.004
about ABC Wedding Planning Consulting.

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.006
I'd like to create an automated reply

00:00:35.006 --> 00:00:37.008
to let the client know I've received their request

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:41.008
for information, as soon as they fill out the contact form.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.008
I'm going to build a flow in Power Automate

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.003
to send this automatic reply.

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:49.000
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.008
I'll select the app launcher

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.003
and open Power Automate.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:56.003
From here, I'll select Create on the left panel

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.006
to make a blank flow.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:01.002
Next, I'll choose automated cloud flow,

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:03.009
the first option in the workspace.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:06.000
You choose this option when you want your flow

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.006
to begin when an action happens.

00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.005
I am using this,

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.006
because my flow will run each time my form is filled out.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.007
This will open a dialogue where you can name the flow

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.008
and choose a trigger.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm going to name this flow Auto Reply.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.007
Power Automate lists the common triggers.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.007
I'll select when a new response is submitted,

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:30.009
then select Create.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.008
Now, Power Automate takes me to the flow builder,

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:35.007
where I can specify that I want to use

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:39.005
the ABC Wedding Planning Consulting interest form.

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:40.006
The flow will be triggered

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.002
each time this form is filled out.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.006
You may have to sign into Microsoft Forms

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.005
before being able to select your form.

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:50.007
My flow will need information from the form,

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.002
including the client's name and email address.

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:57.009
To get the data, I'll select new step.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.007
I'll search for get response,

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.004
and add get response details to my flow.

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:07.002
For Form ID, I, again,

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:11.007
select ABC Wedding Planning Consulting interest form.

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:14.002
I will select Response ID,

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.007
and then select add dynamic content.

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:20.001
This will let me pull the response ID generated

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.000
when a new response is submitted.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.002
Now that I have the response details,

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.001
I can create the step to send the email.

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.009
I'll add a new step, and select Standard.

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.000
I'll be using Office 365 Outlook,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.001
because I want the emails

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.006
to come from my work email address.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:41.009
If I used Mail, emails would be sent from my personal email.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.005
I will use send an email V2,

00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:48.003
and then start composing the automatic email response.

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:51.006
In the to field, I will select ad dynamic content,

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:55.001
and use the email address the client provided.

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:59.004
For subject, I'll enter Wedding Planning Interest.

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:02.001
In the body, I will add the submitter's first name

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.005
to make it feel more personal.

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:09.000
I will add dynamic content and select First Name.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.008
I'll enter my message.

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:14.003
Hello, First Name, thank you for contacting us.

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:18.004
We look forward to making your wedding day special.

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:24.006
One of our associates will be following up with you shortly.

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.008
After creating a flow, I'll select Save

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:29.006
in the upper right, and test my flow.

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:31.009
I always check my flow for errors first,

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.006
by selecting flow checker.

00:03:34.006 --> 00:03:36.006
I have no errors or warnings,

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:39.000
and can test by selecting Test Flow,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.002
and manually triggering it.

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:52.005
Isaiah has the form open, and will submit a response.

00:03:52.005 --> 00:03:53.007
When the form is submitted,

00:03:53.007 --> 00:04:01.005
this flow I created will run automatically.

00:04:01.005 --> 00:04:05.000
I now see that my flow has run successfully.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.007
The flow automatically sent a response to Isaiah.

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:11.003
Staying on top of communications is pivotal.

00:04:11.003 --> 00:04:13.001
Consider where you can create a flow

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.009
that will immediately respond to your potential customers.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.009
Power Automate allows you to quickly create processes

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.006
that boost your business's communication strategy.
