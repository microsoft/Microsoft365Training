00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.005
- [Instructor] Have you ever been given a table of data

00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.004
and just thought, "Where do I even start to review this?"

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:08.001
I know I have.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.005
Luckily, PivotTables can help you

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.007
make sense of your data easily.

00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.007
In this lesson, I'll show you how PivotTables

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:21.000
can simplify data and present it in an easy to read format.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.007
In the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:27.003
I'll select the app launcher and open Excel.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:31.005
From here, I'll open the Test Sales Order spreadsheet.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.004
You can follow along with this document

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.009
in your exercise files.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:38.004
We have lots of good data in here.

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:41.004
Let's see what it looks like in a PivotTable.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:44.003
There are two PivotTables in this workbook,

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:48.006
Pivot Table by Product and Pivot Table by Customer.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.009
I'll select the Pivot Table by Product tab

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.002
near the bottom of the screen.

00:00:53.002 --> 00:00:56.007
This table not only sorts the data by products,

00:00:56.007 --> 00:01:00.009
but also provides an overview of who purchased each product.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.000
Since this table combines the customer

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and total spending per item data points,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.003
I can easily see that the total sales

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:12.003
for AWC's Logo Cap was $277.

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:16.003
And that Eastside Department Store purchased the most.

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.002
Place your cursor inside the PivotTable

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:21.002
by selecting cell B3.

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.006
Then in the top ribbon select the PivotTable tab,

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.002
then select Field List.

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:29.001
In the PivotTable Fields panel

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.009
you can see the two columns selected under rows,

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.004
Product and Customer.

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:39.003
This corresponds to the two columns in A and B on the left.

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:41.009
There's also a column in Values,

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.006
Sum of LineTotal, which corresponds to column C

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.008
and aggregates customer product in the sum total.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.002
Now let's look at the PivotTable that is sorted by customer

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:57.001
by selecting the Pivot Table by Customer tab at the bottom.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.002
This shows the breakdown of items purchased by customer.

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:05.001
Here you see that Action Bicycle Specialists

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:11.004
purchased 10 AWC Logo Caps and spent $38 on Bike Wash.

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.007
In this table I can easily add and remove columns

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.002
by selecting and deselecting the headers

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.003
in the PivotTable Fields panel.

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.004
I'll select UnitPrice which will add unit price

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:28.003
to the PivotTable to show the individual price of each item.

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.001
The PivotTable function in Excel

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.007
is a great way to quickly sort and analyze

00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:35.006
any data points you've been given.

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:37.007
Think about how you can introduce PivotTables

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:41.004
into your projects and in doing so, save yourself some time.
