00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.008
- [Narrator] Gathering feedback is a vital part

00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:05.005
of any business workflow.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.006
In this lesson, I'll show you how to share Power BI reports

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.000
with your team.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.004
It's time to tell your story with data.

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.009
The easiest way to share your data with stakeholders

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.005
and collaborators is through exporting a PDF.

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.001
You can install Power BI on your PC

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.006
by going to the Microsoft Store and searching for Power BI.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.007
Once I have a Power BI report ready to distribute,

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.009
I'll export the file.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.000
In the upper left menu, I'll select File, Export

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.005
and Export to PDF.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:44.002
Power BI exports a PDF format of your data,

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.009
saving it to your downloads folder

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:50.002
and opening it in your PC's default PDF viewer.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.003
Now I can use it like any other file.

00:00:53.003 --> 00:00:55.007
I'll return to Power BI.

00:00:55.007 --> 00:00:57.001
To make your reports accessible

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.004
by colleagues and customers online,

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:01.007
your organization will need to have a subscription

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:03.006
to Power BI.

00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:05.006
To publish your reports to the cloud,

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.005
you'll need to sign into your Microsoft 365 account

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:18.007
with the button in the upper right corner of the screen.

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:21.003
Then to export the file to the web,

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:22.002
on the home ribbon, select Publish,

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:27.008
select My workspace and continue.

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.006
Power BI will begin publishing.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:34.007
In the results window, select open in Power BI.

00:01:34.007 --> 00:01:36.004
Power BI on the web opens,

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:40.002
and I can see the same report I created on the desktop.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:42.007
I'm ready to share this report with my team,

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.006
so I'll select Share and then enter the names of the people

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:51.003
in my organization that I want to share it with.

00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:52.005
I'll add a quick message

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:56.003
and then select Send.

00:01:56.003 --> 00:01:58.006
Another advantage of having an online subscription

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:02.008
to Power BI is the ability to create dashboards.

00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:05.006
While reports are a page of visualizations,

00:02:05.006 --> 00:02:09.007
you can think of dashboards as a story based on reports.

00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:11.005
I'll select Home on the left menu

00:02:11.005 --> 00:02:13.000
and then I'll open a sample report

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.004
supplied by Power BI, the Sales and Returns Sample.

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.001
There are a few reports listed under pages.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.003
Let's look at the net sales and returns.

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:25.003
Both reports have the Category Breakdown

00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:27.008
and Store Breakdown visualization.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.000
I want to create a side by side report

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.008
with these three category breakdowns,

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:36.002
sales, returns and store.

00:02:36.002 --> 00:02:38.007
Instead of recreating the visualization,

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:40.001
I can create a dashboard

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:44.003
by pinning the visualizations to a new dashboard.

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.008
In the upper right corner of each visualization,

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:49.002
select the pin icon.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.005
The Pin to dashboard dialogue appears.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.003
I can create a new dashboard and name it Sales Dashboard,

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:58.006
then select Pin.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.007
Now on the left menu, I'll select Workspaces,

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:05.009
My workspace, and select the Sales Dashboard.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:09.009
This is where the visualization is pinned to the dashboard.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.009
I could continue to add more visualizations

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:15.004
to this dashboard from other Power BI reports.

00:03:15.004 --> 00:03:16.009
From here, you can tell a story

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.008
about product sales and profitability.

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:21.007
Power BI provides several options

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:24.001
to collaborate and review reports.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.005
Try sharing your reports with colleagues for feedback.

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.003
Collaboration is essential to growth

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:32.003
and ensures that stakeholders have the chance

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.009
to sign off on the visualizations you create

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.008
before they are shared with the world.
