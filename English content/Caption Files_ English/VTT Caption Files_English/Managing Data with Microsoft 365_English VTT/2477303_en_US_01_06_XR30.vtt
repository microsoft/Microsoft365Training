00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] Collaboration is key

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.007
to any business's successful model.

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:05.006
As business consultant and author, Ken Blanchard once said,

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:11.009
"None of us is as smart as all of us."

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.009
In this lesson, I'll show you how to share your form

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.004
with collaborators so that they can view,

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.009
edit, and review the results of your form.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.009
I'll show use the two best options

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.002
for sharing with your team and organization

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.003
so you can decide which is best for you.

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.008
In the top left-corner of office.com

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:36.003
I'll select the app launcher and open Forms.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:38.001
From here, I'll open the Wedding Planning

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.003
Consulting Interest form.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:42.009
To share this form with someone's specific on my team,

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.001
I'll select Share in the upper right corner.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:48.001
At the bottom is Share to collaborate,

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.009
and I'll select Get a link to view and edit.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.009
If I select the Users with an Office 365 work

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:59.003
or school account dropdown two additional options appear.

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.002
I'll share this with only those who need it

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.005
by selecting Specific people

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.006
in my organization can view and edit.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.008
I can now enter the team member

00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:11.007
that will help me with this form, Isaiah.

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:15.003
Now, two people have access Isaiah and myself.

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.001
If instead, I want to share this form

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:19.007
with anyone in my organization, I'll change it

00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:23.004
to People in my organization can view and edit.

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:24.008
Now, I can copy a link to send it

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.006
to my colleague Lynn for review.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.008
So I'll copy the link and message it to Lynn.

00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:32.002
Lynn and I can now collaborate

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:36.000
and get this form ready to send to prospective clients.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.004
As you create forms, be sure to include

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:42.001
at least one other team member in the review process.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.004
Co-creating and collaborating in Microsoft 365

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.008
is a great way to make sure

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:49.002
your forms are ready to share with the world.
