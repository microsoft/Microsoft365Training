00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] As a project manager,

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.007
you'll likely use one of the two common

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.007
project management processes,

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:08.003
Waterfall and Agile.

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:09.006
In this lesson,

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.007
I'll show you how to use Microsoft Project

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:15.001
to quickly create a framework for your projects.

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.007
First, Waterfall is a commonly used

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.006
project management process.

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.002
In Waterfall projects,

00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.002
each phase is dependent on the completion

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:25.000
of the previous phase.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So when mapped out, it looks like a waterfall.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.001
Another project management process is Agile.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:32.009
In the Agile methodology,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.001
a project is broken down into segments called sprints,

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:39.003
which are small cycles to complete top priority tasks

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:41.004
from a backlog of work.

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:43.009
The backlog is the full list of all tasks

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:47.004
that need to be completed for project success.

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:49.002
I'll start from office.com,

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:51.009
select the app launcher in the top left corner,

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.006
and open Project.

00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:55.006
Note that using Project for the web

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:59.005
requires an active subscription to Microsoft Project.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:02.001
To set up the framework for an Agile project,

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:07.008
I'll create a new project by selecting New Blank Project.

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:15.000
I'll select the project name and rename it to Wardrobe.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.001
I'll set the start date to be the first day of next month,

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:25.004
then close the panel using the X in the top right.

00:01:25.004 --> 00:01:28.001
Then, I'll select Board view at the top.

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:35.005
I'll select Bucket 1 and rename it to Backlog.

00:01:35.005 --> 00:01:37.004
Next, I'll select Add bucket,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:40.000
and enter Week 1 and Week 2

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
as the names for the next two buckets.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.001
Now I'll enter some items in my backlog.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:52.001
I'll select add task under Backlog,

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:55.002
and enter choose color scheme.

00:01:55.002 --> 00:02:13.003
Select Add task, and continue until all tasks are added.

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:17.004
Now drag the highest priority tasks to the Week 1 bucket.

00:02:17.004 --> 00:02:20.003
This will be our first sprint.

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:23.002
Everything is dependent on choosing the color scheme,

00:02:23.002 --> 00:02:24.007
so that will be first.

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.006
Then I'll drag over a few more tasks

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:32.009
that belong in Week 1.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.005
Microsoft Project can be used as a framework

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:38.003
for many project management processes.

00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:40.007
As you manage more and more projects,

00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:42.006
you'll soon discover which processes

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:44.000
best suit your workflow.
