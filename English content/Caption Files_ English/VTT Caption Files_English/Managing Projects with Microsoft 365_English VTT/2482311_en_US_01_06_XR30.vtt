00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Sharing lists with team members

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.009
ensures everyone has up-to-date information on all projects

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
and can collaborate more effectively with each other.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.006
In this lesson, I'll show you how to ensure

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.004
people see up-to-date content

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.008
and collaborate with relevant stakeholders using lists.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.008
First, I'll show you how to share a list

00:00:18.008 --> 00:00:21.001
with a specific person.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.001
I'll start from office.com.

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.007
Select the app launcher in the upper-left corner

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.000
and open Lists.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
From here, I'll open Checklist for wedding.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.004
In the top ribbon, select Share.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm going to send this list for review

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to my collaborator, Lynne, by entering her name.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.009
For the message, I'll enter, "Please review, thanks!"

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.009
I'll select Anyone with the link can edit

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.000
to restrict access.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.004
I'll select Specific people

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.007
since I only want this link to be accessed by Lynne.

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:05.006
Select Apply to save, then select Send.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:06.007
Lynne will receive an email

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:09.003
indicating that I shared the checklist.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:11.009
Close the dialogue.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.008
To share your list as view only,

00:01:13.008 --> 00:01:16.006
select the Share button on the top ribbon.

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:17.007
I want to change the setting

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:20.002
so anyone with the link can view this list.

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:23.004
I'll select the Can edit dropdown next to the To field

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:26.001
and choose Can view.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.009
Now when I select Copy,

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.003
Lists will create the shareable link to the list

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.008
that is view only.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.003
The link to the page is copied to the clipboard.

00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:37.000
I can send this link in a chat or email.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.001
Sharing lists with colleagues is easy.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.009
You can use it to simply inform others

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.007
with a view-only version,

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:45.009
or you can share a list for collaboration with edit access.

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.008
This week, try sharing one of your lists with a colleague.
