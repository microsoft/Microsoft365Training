but this is just the start of your journey

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:06.008
using Microsoft 365.

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.005
Understanding project management

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.002
and organization applications,

00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:12.005

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:13.007
will make a big impact

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.000
on how you take on your next challenge.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.009
Microsoft 365 has many resources to help

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.009
make your professional life more productive.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.007
I want to share a few of those resources with you.

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:26.002

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:30.008
and learn new skills.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:32.007
You can also attend virtual workshops

00:00:32.007 --> 00:00:34.002
and online classes,

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.002

00:00:39.004 --> 00:00:40.005
Thanks for watching.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.008
And I hope that you use these new skills

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.003
to become a better project manager.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.009
