00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.001
- [Instructor] Think of a project

00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.007
you've been wanting to start.

00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:04.004
No matter what the project is,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:08.003
there's no better place to put ideas down than with a list.

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.009
Your brain is already full of information.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.009
Let lists help keep your project organized.

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.006
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create your first list.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.008
In this example, I'm going to use lists to track my budget

00:00:20.008 --> 00:00:23.006
for a client of my wedding planning business.

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:27.002
To get started, in the top left corner of office.com,

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:31.003
I'll select the app launcher and open lists.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:35.008
To create a new list, I'll select new list.

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:38.005
This dialogue allows you to create a blank list,

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.002
a list from Excel or from an existing list.

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.005
I can also create a list from a template.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.009
None of these templates are exactly what I want

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:52.002
so I'll create a blank list.

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:56.000
For the name, I'll enter wedding planning budget.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And for the description,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.008
I'll enter new client wedding planning budget.

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.005
I will leave the color and icon as a default settings

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.007
but you can change them if you want to.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:10.003
I'll save this new list to my list so I can find it later.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:16.008
These details look good to me so I can now select create.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:20.004
By default, a list starts with a single column named title.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.009
I'll rename the title column to item

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.003
by selecting the dropdown arrow next to title

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:31.001
and then select column settings and rename.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:36.009
I'll enter item and then select save.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.004
I'll use this column to enter the item I need to budget

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:45.002
like a photographer, a florist and a venue.

00:01:45.002 --> 00:01:47.006
But just knowing the things I need to budget

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.008
isn't quite enough information.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.000
I'll use a budget column

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.004
to record how much each item should cost.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.007
I'll also need a column to record how much was spent.

00:01:57.007 --> 00:02:01.005
This way, we can see if the client is on budget or not.

00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:05.000
To add another column I'll select add column.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.005
Lists have several standard column types.

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:11.001
I'll choose currency then I'll name it budget

00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:17.001
and select save.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.000
And now I'll create the actual expense column.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.002
Again, I'll select add column, select currency

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.004
and I'll name this column actual.

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:31.006
Select save and there it is.

00:02:31.006 --> 00:02:34.002
Now that I have the column set up, I can enter in the budget

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:35.004
for each vendor.

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.008
I will add my first budget item by selecting new

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:40.004
in the top left corner.

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.008
I will enter a title for the item photographer

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:45.006
and add a budget of $1,200.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:47.003
I haven't purchased this yet,

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:50.008
so I will leave the actual field blank.

00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:54.003
I can then select save to add the photographer.

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:55.007
We've already paid for the venue.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:59.008
So I'll select new, name the item venue

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:04.006
and then enter $5,000 in the budget box.

00:03:04.006 --> 00:03:08.004
We actually spent $5,225

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:12.005
so I'll enter that in the actual expense box

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:14.009
then save the item.

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.004
If I need to see the columns in a different order,

00:03:17.004 --> 00:03:18.004
I can reorder them

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:21.008
by dragging the column to where I want it.

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:24.006
I'd like to see the actuals before the budget

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:27.007
so I can drag the column before budget.

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:29.002
And that's it.

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.002
Try moving a project that you're currently tracking

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.002
on paper into lists.

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:35.007
It can help you supercharge your project.

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:37.005
Think about an upcoming project deadline

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.002
and try building it out in Microsoft lists.

00:03:40.002 --> 00:03:42.002
You're on your way to staying organized.
