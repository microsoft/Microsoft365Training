00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Narrator] A good plan will not only help you

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:03.007
achieve your goals, but also track

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:05.007
all the moving pieces along the way.

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.008
Microsoft Planner is a powerful tool

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.005
that helps you keep track of work,

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.009
so you can focus on the work itself.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.006
In this lesson, I'll show you how to create your first plan,

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.003
organize tasks in the buckets,

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:18.006
and assign them to teammates

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.007
to better document your process.

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.005
In this example, I'll be creating a plan

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:25.001
for a client for my wedding planning business.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.002
I'll start from office.com.

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.008
Select the app launcher in the top left corner,

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:34.004
then open Planner.

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:39.005
I'll select New plan in the upper left corner.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.000
The New Plan dialogue is where you can enter the properties

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of your plan and customize the name and details.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'll name my new plan Lake Wedding.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.007
I'll set the privacy to public,

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.003
so everyone on my team can track it.

00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:53.001
That looks good.

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:59.004
So I'll select Create plan.

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.004
Now I have a brand new plan that's ready to go.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.004
How you organize the plan is important

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.003
so everyone can easily see when the tasks are due.

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:10.001
For wedding planning, you might organize by category,

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.001
like venue and catering.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:15.000
For organization, Planner uses buckets,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.009
which are a way of putting related tasks in one place.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.006
I'll add a Catering bucket and a Venue bucket.

00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:24.008
Select Add new bucket and enter Catering.

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.004
Let's do the same for venue.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:31.003
Select Add new bucket and enter Venue.

00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:32.008
How granular the buckets will be

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:35.001
depends on each project's needs.

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.002
For the Catering bucket, I'll add the tasks

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.002
that need to be done first,

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.008
identify a caterer, have a tasting

00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.009
and select first course.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.002
Select Add task under Catering.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:51.000
The new task card appears

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.001
and you can enter the name, due date,

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.003
and assign it to a person.

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:58.006
For now, I'll keep it simple and only add the task name.

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:04.004
Identify a caterer, then select Add task.

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:14.006
Then I'll do the same for the other tasks.

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:15.009
For the Venue bucket,

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.007
I'll include tasks like touring potential venues,

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:21.002
finalizing a venue and placing a deposit.

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:40.002
Select Add task under Venue to add these tasks.

00:02:40.002 --> 00:02:42.005
Now this is starting to look like a plan.

00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:43.008
Now that I have tasks,

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:47.000
I can assign members of my team to complete these tasks.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.001
Each one of my team members has an area of expertise

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.005
and I'll assign the tasks accordingly.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:55.004
Isaiah knows all the wedding spots in the area,

00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.009
so I'll assign Isaiah the venue task.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.007
To do this, I'll select finalizing potential venues,

00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:05.009
and Planner displays the task properties.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.009
I'll select assign and assign this task to Isaiah

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.001
by typing in their name

00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:15.000
and choosing it from the dropdown menu.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.002
The Assign task and add user to plan dialogue appears.

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:21.004
I'll select Assign and add.

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:24.008
By assigning and adding, Isaiah is first added to the plan

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:27.008
and the task is assigned to them.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.000
I can also go through and set the due dates of each task.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.009
For this example, I'll set the due date

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.002
for the end of the month.

00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:40.008
I'll select Due date and select March 31st.

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:44.006
You can use Priority to signify how urgent each task is.

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.009
Finalizing the venue is high priority.

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:48.008
So under the Priority dropdown,

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:52.008
I'll set the priority to Important.

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:54.004
Close the Task Properties dialogue

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.008
by selecting the X in the upper right corner.

00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:00.005
I now see Isaiah is assigned to assist the client

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:01.009
in finalizing the venue

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:04.003
and the task is due at the end of the month.

00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:07.007
Isaiah will receive an email with the task assignment,

00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:08.007
and that's it.

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:12.004
I've created a plan, organized it by using buckets

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:14.008
and created tasks assigned to my team.

00:04:14.008 --> 00:04:16.006
Next time you start a project,

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:19.005
try using Microsoft Planner to create your own plan

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:21.005
and let it help you track your work.
