00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] When you're managing a project,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
you'll be tracking lots

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.008
of moving parts and tasks.

00:00:04.008 --> 00:00:08.002
Microsoft Project has powerful work management capabilities

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:10.009
that can be used by both project managers

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.006
and team members alike.

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:14.007
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:17.002
Microsoft Project's key features.

00:00:17.002 --> 00:00:19.006
The first feature I want to highlight in Project

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.006
is task dependencies.

00:00:21.006 --> 00:00:23.003
A project is often made up of tasks

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:25.000
that depend on each other.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.002
I'll start by opening the August wedding project

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:28.001
I've been working on

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:30.006
so you can see how Project lists the various pieces

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:33.003
that need to come together for the event.

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:36.004
For example, the determined budget task is dependent

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:39.000
on the discussion with the couple about wedding size,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.001
location and scope.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.002
Grid view is fine for listing out the tasks,

00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:46.008
but with dependencies,

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:48.005
it's much easier to understand

00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:57.004
the information using a timeline.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:58.008
This view gives me the timeline

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:01.005
of when tasks are due and their dependencies.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.008
Once dependencies are created,

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:05.003
I can see the critical path.

00:01:05.003 --> 00:01:07.008
The critical path shows the specific tasks,

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:11.000
that if delayed, will delay the entire project.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.004
By analyzing a critical path,

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.008
you can also identify how to shorten the project length.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.001
To view the critical path,

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.001
on the top menu,

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:25.008
select Filters and toggle Show Critical Path on.

00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.003
All the tasks highlighted in red need

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.009
to be completed on time to meet the deadline.

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.005
Microsoft Project will help you manage large timelines

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:35.009
and projects.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.007
If you need to identify dependencies

00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:40.007
or the critical path, check out Microsoft Project.
