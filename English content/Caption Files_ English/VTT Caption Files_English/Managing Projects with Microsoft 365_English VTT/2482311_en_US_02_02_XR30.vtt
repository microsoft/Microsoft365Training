00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.008
- [Instructor] As a project manager,

00:00:01.008 --> 00:00:04.007
I'm coordinating multiple projects throughout my day.

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.006
I need a way to manage my work

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.006
to achieve maximum productivity.

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:11.005
Becoming comfortable in Planner helps me stay on top

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.002
of my projects on a day-to-day basis.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:17.000
In this lesson, I'm going to show you the easiest way

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.004
to access the most important parts of Microsoft Planner

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.006
so you can start managing your plans.

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.004
I'll start from office.com and select the app launcher

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.009
in the top left corner.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.005
Then open Planner.

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.000
This opens Planner hub where you'll find all the plans

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.004
you have access to.

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.009
The navigation menu on the left is where I look to create

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.007
a new plan and find tasks assigned to me.

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.005
I've pinned the June wedding plan and below it is a list

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:44.005
of recent plans I've been working on.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.001
The recent section shows the plans

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.007
I've opened most recently.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.000
To find all your plans, select all.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.003
Finally in the left menu, select assigned to me

00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.004
to see a list of all the tasks that are assigned

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:57.008
to your account.

00:00:57.008 --> 00:01:01.000
By default, my tasks are grouped by progress with buckets

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.004
for not started, in progress, and completed.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.005
Tasks with a date highlighted in red are overdue,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:09.004
making them easy to identify.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:12.002
I can also use the group by dropdown in the top right

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.006
to sort my tasks by priority.

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.008
This way I can see which ones I should focus on first.

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.005
Consider an upcoming event you need to plan.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:24.004
I encourage you to open the Planner app

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:26.009
and explore the features to optimize the efficiency

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.000
of your next event.
