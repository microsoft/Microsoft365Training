00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] Microsoft Planner is a great tool

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to keep track of your work.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this lesson, I'll share a few pro tips

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.006
to help you get the most out of Planner.

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.005
I'll start from Office.com

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.001
and in the top left corner,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:19.003
select the app launcher and open Planner.

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.003
I'll start by opening the June wedding plan

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.000
that I've been working on.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.003
My first pro tip is to add attachments

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.002
to help keep relevant documents with your tasks.

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.007
In this example, I'm assisting a client with photographers

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:34.009
and I've already created

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.002
the recommended photographers document.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:38.007
Now I want to attach that document

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:41.000
to the select photographer task.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.002
I'll select the task and select add attachment.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:50.002
I have three choices - from computer,

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.007
from team files and a link to URL.

00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:55.009
Since my document is on my computer,

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.003
I'll select from computer.

00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:02.008
Navigate to the file, then select open.

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:04.007
Close the task dialogue

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:09.003
and now you can see the attachment on the task card.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:12.003
You can also add checklist items to tasks.

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:14.003
Checklist items are things that need to be done

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:15.007
to complete the task

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:19.001
but are too small to justify their own task.

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.008
For example, let's say you want to create two checklist items

00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:24.007
for the select florist task.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.007
One for the wedding ceremony and one for the reception.

00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:30.003
Open the select florist task.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:33.001
Under checklist, select add an item.

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.007
Here I can enter two checklist items -

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:39.002
wedding arrangements and reception arrangements.

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:43.005
Then select show on card.

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.003
When I close the task, I can see the checklist items

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:49.001
under select florist.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.001
Finally, you can copy a task

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.002
instead of creating a task from scratch every time.

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:56.005
In this example, I've already created the task

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:57.008
for initial budget

00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.006
and I need to create a task for finalized budget.

00:02:00.006 --> 00:02:03.008
I'll select more options on the initial budget task card

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:08.005
and choose copy task.

00:02:08.005 --> 00:02:11.000
Enter a name for the new task.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.003
I'll name it, finalize budget.

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:16.002
Assign it to the four to eight weeks prior bucket

00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:18.003
and select copy.

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.004
Try out checklist, attachments and duplication

00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.000
the next time you're setting up a plan

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and see how much time you can save.
