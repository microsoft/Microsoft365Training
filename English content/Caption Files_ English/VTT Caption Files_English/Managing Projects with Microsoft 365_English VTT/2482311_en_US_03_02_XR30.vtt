00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
- [Instructor] Microsoft Project

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.003
has a wide variety of helpful tools.

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:05.005
In order to get the most out of these tools,

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:06.008
you need to know what they are

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:08.005
and where to find them.

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:11.004
In this lesson, I'll show you how to locate key features

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:13.004
within Microsoft Project.

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:16.006
I'll start from Office.com, select the App Launcher

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.003
in the top left corner, and open Project.

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:20.007
Note that using Projects of the web

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:22.001
requires an active subscription

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:23.009
to Microsoft Project.

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.000
The Project homepage is where you'll find all

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.009
the Microsoft Projects you have access to.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.001
At the top, there's a new blank Project button.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.009
I can also see two main sections

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.003
on the homepage: Favorites and Recent.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.003
Favorites has all the projects I've tagged as important.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:43.001
I'm currently working on the August Wedding project.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:44.008
I can mark this project as a favorite

00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:49.006
by hovering over the project and selecting Mark Favorite.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:51.006
As I complete projects,

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.005
I can un-favorite them by selecting More Options

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.007
and choosing Remove From Favorites.

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.001
The Recent panel contains the projects

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:01.005
you've opened most recently.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.004
When I need to look back

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:06.002
on previous projects, Recent helps me find them quickly.

00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:07.003
As you work with Projects,

00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:10.002
team members may share their projects with you.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:11.002
You can see shared projects

00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.001
by selecting the Shared With Me tab.

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.003
Finally, if you want to narrow your search

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.004
to see just the projects you've created,

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.009
filter by selecting the Created By Me tab.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.003
Now only the projects I've created are displayed.

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:28.004
I encourage you to explore the Project interface

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.000
before creating your first project.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.003
You'll be comfortable

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.007
with this Project management tool in no time.
