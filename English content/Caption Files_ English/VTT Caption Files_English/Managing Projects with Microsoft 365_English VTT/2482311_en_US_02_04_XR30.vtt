00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:00.009
- [Instructor] Whether you're planning

00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.003
a family get-together, business event,

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.004
or a work project, you should organize and keep track

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:09.002
of your work by breaking it down into tasks.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.007
In this lesson, I'll show you how to manage tasks

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.007
in Planner and how to organize everyone's tasks

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.008
to make sure the project is successful.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:19.002
I'll start from office.com.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.008
Select the app launcher in the top left corner

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:26.008
and open Planner.

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:29.000
I'll start by opening the June wedding plan

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.008
that I've been working on.

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:34.004
I've added a few due dates ahead of time.

00:00:34.004 --> 00:00:36.000
When you are assigned to a project,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.008
the first thing you want to know is what's assigned to you.

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:41.001
The different group views are designed to help.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.005
In the upper right, it says the plan is grouped by bucket.

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.007
This is a good view to use when you need to add new tasks.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.003
In the dropdown, choose Assigned To to see what's assigned

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.000
to each person and the due date of each item.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.007
Joni told me they need additional help to accomplish

00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.000
their task of mailing invitations.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.007
I can assign a second person to this task by selecting it,

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:13.000
selecting Assign To, and adding Isaiah.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.009
Now the tasks show up in both of their lists.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.000
To see your project status, you can switch to chart view

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.002
by selecting Charts in the top center.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.002
Chart view gives a high level overview

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.001
of how the project is progressing.

00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.006
This view shows the task count

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.006
and the progress of each task.

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.004
You can see the number of tasks by priority, bucket,

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:39.007
and number of tasks assigned to each member.

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:41.007
When I'm working on a big project,

00:01:41.007 --> 00:01:43.005
there are times when I need to see the tasks

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.003
in a calendar view so I like to use schedule view.

00:01:46.003 --> 00:01:50.008
Select Schedule on the top menu next to Charts.

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:52.009
Here you can see the tasks for the month,

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.009
along with due dates and status.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.008
I'll go ahead and set the start date for a task.

00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.002
I'll select Plan the rehearsal dinner

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:03.000
and in the start date dropdown select one week

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.009
before the due date.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.009
Then close the dialogue.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.008
Planner now shows the dates this task is being worked on.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.007
I can easily move the date by dragging it

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:20.001
to the desired date.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.003
Alternatively, I can drag the right edge to increase

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:34.002
and decrease the length of time for this task.

00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:36.008
The schedule view is also great for adding new tasks

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:39.002
and assigning them to a due date in one step.

00:02:39.002 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's say this client selected a venue

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.006
that did not include a caterer.

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.009
I'll select add task on the right, enter a name,

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:53.007
select Caterer, and add it to the four to six months bucket.

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:56.004
Select Add Task.

00:02:56.004 --> 00:03:02.003
From here, I can drag this task to the date that it's due.

00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:04.005
Seeing what needs to be accomplished by when

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:07.003
and by who is key when it comes to projects.

00:03:07.003 --> 00:03:09.006
With all the different views available in Planner,

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.007
your team can view all the right information

00:03:11.007 --> 00:03:12.008
at the right time.
