00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Narrator] Think about the last event you attended.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.009
Was it virtual or in person?

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.003
You may have received information beforehand to prepare

00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.001
or a link to share photos of the event.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.001
Now think of the preparation that had to happen

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.002
before the event.

00:00:12.002 --> 00:00:14.007
The key to a great event is good planning,

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:16.006
and Microsoft Planner can help.

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:19.008
In this lesson, I'll show you some of the critical benefits

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.004
of using Microsoft Planner

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:24.008
and ways to utilize it for anything you need to plan next.

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:27.006
In this example, I'll show you how I used Planner

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.000
to organize a wedding.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.007
I created buckets for each phase the team completes

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.009
to put the wedding together by the deadline.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:35.009
Planner also keeps due dates clear.

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.008
Knowing when individual tasks are due,

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.001
helps me see the big picture of the timeline.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.000
With Planner, you can enter the dates for the tasks

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.009
to be completed.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.001
Here you can see, I have many tasks,

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.008
including some that have due dates.

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.001
Planner is also a great collaboration tool

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.009
that makes it easy to assign tasks to your team members.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.009
Depending on the size of your project,

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:57.002
you may have many people working with you.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.005
Each member of your team can be assigned tasks

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.009
that speak to their skills.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.004
Here you can see I'm collaborating

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:04.004
with team members for this wedding.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.004
We work together to complete tasks

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:08.005
and can see the progress of the event.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.005
Schedule view lets us see if we're ahead or behind schedule

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:14.006
and if our team members need help completing a task.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.004
Next time you go to organize an event

00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.004
or track the progress of your business,

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:20.002
use Planner to stay organized.
