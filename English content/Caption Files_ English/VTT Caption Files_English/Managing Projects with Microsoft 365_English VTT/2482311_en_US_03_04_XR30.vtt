00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Once you create a project,

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.003
The next step is to add tasks.

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.007
I've found the easiest way

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:07.006
is to think of the big pieces first,

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:11.000
and then fill in the details later.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.003
In this lesson,

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.002
you'll be able to use Microsoft Project

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.004
to add tasks, assigned tasks,

00:00:16.004 --> 00:00:19.001
and set start and end dates.

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:20.000
In this example,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll create a client wedding project.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.008
I'll start from Office.com

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:26.000
Select the app launcher

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.001
in the top-left corner and open Project.

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.001
Note that using Project for the web

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.006
requires an active subscription

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:35.005
to Microsoft Project.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:40.006
Next, I'll select new blank project.

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:42.003
On the Project main page,

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.001
you can see the project name,

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:48.002
and three options for grid, board and timeline.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.009
And on the right there's filters,

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:52.009
and group members and more actions.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.005
Grid view shows the list of tasks

00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.009
for the project and the common task properties.

00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:02.005
Name, quick look, assigned to and duration.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.000
To rename the project,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.009
I'll select untitled project

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.005
in the upper-left corner,

00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:12.001
and I'll enter client wedding.

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.002
I'll set the start date

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:18.008
to the first day of next month.

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.007
Select the X in the upper right corner

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.007
to close.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:27.000
Next, I'll add some tasks by selecting

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.008
add new task and name them.

00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.000
I'll now switch to the board view

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.001
by selecting board in the top menu,

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:44.001
and I can see all the tasks are in bucket one.

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.000
I'll select bucket one to rename this bucket

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.001
to catering.

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.003
I'll then add another bucket for venue

00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:58.001
by selecting add bucket.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:59.009
I'll drag the venue-related tasks

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.007
into the venue bucket.

00:02:04.007 --> 00:02:07.001
Now that the project buckets are set with tasks,

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.006
I can assign them to members of my team.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:11.003
First, I'll switch back to grid view

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:15.002
by selecting grid on the top.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:16.005
Now I can assign tasks

00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.006
using the assigned to column.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:20.005
For the finalized venue task,

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.003
I'll select the assigned to column,

00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:23.005
and enter Isaiah,

00:02:23.005 --> 00:02:34.006
and select them from the dropdown list.

00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:35.007
A dialogue appears

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:37.007
asking whether I want to add Isaiah

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:39.001
to the project group.

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.000
Select add a group,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.003
then select create and assign.

00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:46.009
I'll assign identify a caterer to Lynne

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:49.005
by entering her name in the assigned to column,

00:02:49.005 --> 00:02:58.004
and selecting assign and add.

00:02:58.004 --> 00:02:59.009
The next I need to add

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.006
is the duration of each task.

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:04.005
The duration is how long I expect

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.000
the task to take.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.004
I'll select the duration column

00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:09.002
for the have a tasting task,

00:03:09.002 --> 00:03:12.001
and enter one to set the duration to one day.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:18.009
I'll do the same for the other tasks.

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.008
Now, when I go back to the board view,

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:22.002
I see each task,

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:23.003
who it's assigned to,

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:26.001
and the number of days to complete.

00:03:26.001 --> 00:03:29.003
Next, I want to set the start dates.

00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:31.005
Select timeline on the top menu,

00:03:31.005 --> 00:03:33.000
and notice that each task

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.002
begins on the first day of next month.

00:03:35.002 --> 00:03:36.009
And that the length of the box

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.007
is set by the duration I entered.

00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:42.009
I can drag each task to the correct start date,

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.007
or select it and enter it in the start field,

00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:52.008
and select X in the upper-right corner to save.

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:54.008
Before you start your next project,

00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:57.001
explore how project can map your tasks,

00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.001
and help you collaborate with your team.
