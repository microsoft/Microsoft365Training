00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
- [Instructor] I love when I can quickly create lists.

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:05.000
With Microsoft Lists,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.006
I'm able to consistently stay on top of what I need to do.

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:09.009
In this lesson,

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.005
I'm going to show you the simplest way

00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:14.009
to access the most important parts of Microsoft Lists.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.009
I'll start from Office.com,

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.004
select the App Launcher and Lists.

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.003
Here, you can see the Lists homepage

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:24.009
with Favorites displayed first.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.005
My Favorites contains the lists I've tagged as important.

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:31.005
Here, you see my Conference Plan list.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.007
To add a Favorite, select the star icon

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.001
when hovering over any list.

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.000
I will hover over Spring wedding show

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.007
and select favorite this list

00:00:39.007 --> 00:00:42.005
because that event is coming up soon.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.001
As I complete projects or finish lists,

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.007
I can remove this list from Favorites by selecting the star.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.009
When you need to look back on previous projects,

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.008
Recent lists can help you find them quickly.

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.006
To see all the lists you've created,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.001
use the dropdown to the right of Recent lists

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:03.001
and select My lists.

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.009
I can now see all the lists I've created in a single page.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.001
Harness the power of Microsoft Lists

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.003
by signing in and beginning to navigate

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.002
all the features in the app.

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.003
You'll be amazed by the improvements you'll make

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:16.008
in your project organization.
