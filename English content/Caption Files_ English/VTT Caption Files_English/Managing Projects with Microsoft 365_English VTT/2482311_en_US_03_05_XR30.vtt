00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.007
- [Instructor] Big projects are achievable

00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:04.000
when you've broken them down into smaller tasks

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.006
and have added dependencies

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.002
to see what needs to be done first.

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.008
In this lesson, I'll use an example client wedding project

00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:14.001
to show how to add subtasks and dependencies

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:15.006
in Microsoft Project

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:18.006
so that you can stay on top of all the details.

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.004
I'll start from office.com.

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.008
Select the app launcher in the top left corner

00:00:22.008 --> 00:00:25.000
and open Project.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.006
Note that using Project for the web

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.007
requires an active subscription to Microsoft Project.

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:33.007
I'll open the Client wedding project.

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.007
I'm in grid view by default.

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.005
From here, I can start to break down some of these tasks

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.007
into smaller subtasks.

00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.005
For example, I have Identify a caterer as a task,

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.007
but I know there are subtasks associated with this item.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.004
I will add the subtasks.

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:52.004
First, I'll add Determine allergies as a task

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:58.006
by selecting Add new task at the bottom.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.001
Place your cursor to the left

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.004
of the newly created task number.

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:07.008
Then drag the task below the Identify a caterer task.

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.006
Now to make Determine allergies a subtask,

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:17.005
I'll select More options and choose Make subtask.

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.001
I'll add one more subtask

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:27.008
and drag it below Determine allergies.

00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:29.007
I'll assign these tasks to Lynne.

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.006
Select the Assigned to column for Determine allergies

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.009
and enter Lynne.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.000
And in the Duration column, enter 5 days.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.005
Repeat these steps for Finalize budget,

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.001
but instead enter 2 days.

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.009
Notice that the Identify a caterer task Duration

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.009
is now automatically set to 5 days,

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.007
since the larger Duration of the two subtasks is 5 days.

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:59.004
These tasks are dependent on each other,

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.005
meaning that one of the tasks needs to be completed

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.004
before the next task can be started.

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:08.007
In this case, Determining allergies must happen

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.008
before the budget can be finalized.

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.001
To create dependencies, I'll select Open details

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.000
on the Finalize budget subtask.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.003
In the Depends on section, select Add dependency,

00:02:20.003 --> 00:02:24.002
then choose Determine allergies.

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:28.009
Close the task panel by selecting the X in the top right.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.002
Notice that the Duration for Identify a caterer

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:35.002
changed to 7 days, since Finalize budget can't start

00:02:35.002 --> 00:02:38.004
until the Determine allergies task is complete.

00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:41.008
You now have two more tools to manage your projects.

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.008
Use subtasks when you need to break down larger work items

00:02:44.008 --> 00:02:46.003
into smaller tasks,

00:02:46.003 --> 00:02:49.007
and dependencies to identify when tasks can't start

00:02:49.007 --> 00:02:52.000
before another is completed.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.001
Try out subtasks and dependencies

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.003
to help you organize your next project.
