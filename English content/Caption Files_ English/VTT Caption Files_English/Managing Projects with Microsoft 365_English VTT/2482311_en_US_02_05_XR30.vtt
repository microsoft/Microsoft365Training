00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] It's natural that, over time,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.004
a plan will evolve and change.

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:06.006
Plans are living documents.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.004
In this lesson, I'll show you how

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.004
to communicate changes using Microsoft Planner.

00:00:11.004 --> 00:00:14.002
From office.com in the top left corner,

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:21.003
I'll select the app launcher, then open Planner.

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.004
I'll start by opening the June wedding plan

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:27.000
that I've been working on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.008
Select More on the top menu then, choose Plan Settings.

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.005
First, I can update my plan to have

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:43.003
a different background, I'll select this one.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:49.003
Next, select Notifications.

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:51.009
In the bottom section, I can see that Planner

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:55.006
is already sending me individual notifications for my tasks.

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.004
I want to increase transparency across my team,

00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:01.000
and make everyone aware when tasks are completed.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.002
Since I'm the group owner in the Group Email setting

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:06.003
I'll select Send email to the group

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:14.001
when a task is assigned or completed, then select Save.

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.003
Joni just notified me that the marriage license

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:22.004
has been obtained, I'll mark that task as complete.

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:23.009
Now, the whole team will receive

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.007
an email and we can notify the client.

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.004
Finally, I can share my public plan across my organization.

00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.007
I'm onboarding a new hire and I want them

00:01:32.007 --> 00:01:35.000
to be able to see what the team is working on.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.005
I can select More and, in the dropdown,

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:42.009
choose Copy link to plan.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.005
The link is copied to my clipboard.

00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:47.005
I can now send it in a Teams message or email.

00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:50.000
By creating visibility across plans,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.005
your team can be even more effective.

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.003
Consider turning on notifications

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:55.007
and sharing your next plan.
