00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:02.006
- [Instructor] The most efficient way to create a new list

00:00:02.006 --> 00:00:05.006
with a professional look is to use templates.

00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.005
If you can find a template that aligns with your scenario,

00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.005
it can save you a lot of time.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.003
In this lesson, I'll show you

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.008
how to bring your own list to life using templates.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.007
I'll start from Office.com.

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.008
Select the app launcher in the upper left corner

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:21.007
and open Lists.

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.000
In this example, I'm planning an event.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.007
So I want to find out if there's a template

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.001
that will help me create it.

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.008
So, I'll start by selecting new list.

00:00:30.008 --> 00:00:33.005
The template section shows templates I can use.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:37.006
Here's an event itinerary template that looks good.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:41.000
When I select it, I'll see a preview with sample data.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.008
Most of the columns look helpful

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.005
but I don't need all of them

00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:47.007
so I'll customize it after the list has been created.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.009
Select use template.

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.009
On the next window, enter a name.

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:57.001
I'll call mine, March Wedding Show

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.004
and enter description, expo center show.

00:01:01.004 --> 00:01:03.008
I'll keep the calendar icon in the default color

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.009
and have it stored in my lists.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.006
Next, I'll select create

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:11.000
to create my list from the template.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.006
Now that the list is created,

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.003
I can customize it to fit my needs.

00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:17.000
I don't need the speaker's column

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.002
so I can either hide or delete it.

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.009
If I hide the column, it will still exist in the list

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.007
but will not be displayed.

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:26.003
I'll hide the speaker column instead of deleting it

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.003
in case someone else ends up presenting with me.

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.002
I'll select the dropdown next to the speaker's heading,

00:01:32.002 --> 00:01:37.002
then select column settings and choose hide this column.

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.009
The speaker's column is no longer visible.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.000
I won't have session codes for my event

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.006
so I wanted to delete the session code column.

00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:47.003
So I'll select the dropdown next to session code,

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:51.007
select column settings, and choose edit.

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.004
This brings up the edit column panel.

00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.005
Now I can select delete in the bottom right corner.

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:01.007
Confirm in the window and the column is removed.

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.003
Reorganizing columns allows me

00:02:03.003 --> 00:02:05.004
to keep related items together.

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.009
I prefer the description column

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.007
to be next to the session name.

00:02:08.007 --> 00:02:10.002
So I can select description

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:15.000
and drag it to the right of session name.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.006
Now I'm ready to start adding my own data.

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:21.006
I'll add some sessions by selecting new.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:25.000
The first thing on the itinerary for this show is breakfast.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.006
So, I'll enter that as a title

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:30.006
and I'll select meal for the session type.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:31.008
And in the description field,

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:36.005
I'll enter, bring business cards.

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:41.008
Finally, select save at the top and the list item is added.

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:42.008
So there you have it.

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:46.000
Creating a list from a template helps me get started quickly

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.006
and they look great.

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:50.003
So go ahead, open Microsoft Lists

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.001
and look for a template that matches your next project.
