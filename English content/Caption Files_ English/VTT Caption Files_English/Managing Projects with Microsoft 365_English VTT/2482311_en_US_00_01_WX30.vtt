00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.005
- [Narrator] Often in life, getting to where you want to go

00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.001
starts with setting specific achievable goals.

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.004
While some of those goals can be reached simply and quickly,

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.000
others require a lot of thoughtful planning,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.004
energy, time, coordination, and execution.

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:19.002
Throughout your life and career,

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.000
you'll likely take on many projects.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.001
Managing those projects isn't always straightforward.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.001
There are often different tasks,

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.003
people involved, and steps in between.

00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:33.001
My name is Christine Matheney,

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:36.002
and I'm a program manager at Microsoft.

00:00:36.002 --> 00:00:38.003
In this course, I'm going to show you

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.008
how to use Microsoft 365 apps

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.005
to increase your project management skills.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:44.006
You'll learn how to create

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:47.005
and share lists in Microsoft Lists,

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.004
develop a plan in Microsoft Planner,

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.008
and manage your project with Microsoft Project.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:57.004
Microsoft 365 has extraordinary tools

00:00:57.004 --> 00:01:00.003
to help you manage your projects like a pro.

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.007
